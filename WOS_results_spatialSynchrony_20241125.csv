One common cause of spatial synchrony, termed the Moran effect, occurs when populations respond to environmental fluctuations, such as weather, that are correlated over space. Although the degree of spatial synchrony in environmental fluctuations can differ between seasons and different population processes occur in different seasons, the impact on population spatial synchrony is uncertain because prior work has largely assumed that the spatial synchrony of environmental fluctuations and their effect on populations are consistent over annual sampling intervals. We used theoretical models to examine how seasonality in population processes and the spatial synchrony of environmental drivers affect population spatial synchrony. We found that population spatial synchrony can depend not only on the spatial synchrony of environmental drivers but also on the degree to which environmental fluctuations are correlated across seasons, locally, and across space. Moreover, measurements of synchrony from snapshot population censuses may not accurately reflect synchrony during other parts of the year. Together, these results show that neglecting seasonality in environmental conditions and population processes is consequential for understanding population spatial synchrony and its driving mechanisms.",,,,,"Shugart, Herman/C-5156-2009","Shoemaker, Lauren/0000-0002-4465-8432",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,OCT 1,2023,202,4,,,,,399,412,,10.1086/725804,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/725804,,OCT 2023,,,,,,37792915,,,,,WOS:001061911000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we developed a spatially implicit host-parasitoid model. Beside the above three mechanisms, correlation of environmental noise on different trophic levels was also included. Patterns of spatial synchrony was considered for stable, quasi-periodic, periodic, and chaotic population dynamics, respectively In the stable region, a theoretical exploration based on a linearized 2-patch model was firstly done. Theoretical prediction shows that trophic correlation of environmental noises is another mechanism causing spatial synchrony. Numerical simulations of 2-patch and multi-patch models also verified the prediction. More simulations in other region show that periodic and quasi-periodic populations could be synchronized, while chaotic populations are hard to synchronize.

J,"Hopson, J; Fox, JW",,,,"Hopson, Jessica; Fox, Jeremy W.",,,Occasional long distance dispersal increases spatial synchrony of population cycles,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spatially separated populations of the same species often exhibit correlated fluctuations in abundance, a phenomenon known as spatial synchrony. Dispersal can generate spatial synchrony. In nature, most individuals disperse short distances with a minority dispersing long distances. The effect of occasional long distance dispersal on synchrony is untested, and theoretical predictions are contradictory. Occasional long distance dispersal might either increase both overall synchrony and the spatial scale of synchrony, or reduce them. We conducted a protist microcosm experiment to test whether occasional long distance dispersal increases or decreases overall synchrony and the spatial scale of synchrony. We assembled replicate 15-patch ring metapopulations of the protist predator Euplotes patella and its protist prey Tetrahymena pyriformis. All metapopulations experienced the same dispersal rate, but differed in dispersal distance. Some metapopulations experienced strictly short distance (nearest neighbour) dispersal, others experienced a mixture of short- and long distance dispersal. Occasional long distance dispersal increased overall spatial synchrony and the spatial scale of synchrony for both prey and predators, though the effects were not statistically significant for predators. As predicted by theory, dispersal generated spatial synchrony by entraining the phases of the predator-prey cycles in different patches, a phenomenon known as phase locking. Our results are consistent with theoretical models predicting that occasional long distance dispersal increases spatial synchrony. However, our results also illustrate that the spatial scale of synchrony need not match the spatial scale of the processes generating synchrony. Even strictly short distance dispersal maintained high spatial synchrony for many generations at spatial scales much longer than the dispersal distance, thanks to phase locking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JAN,2019,88,1,,,,,154,163,,10.1111/1365-2656.12905,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12905,,,,,,,,30280379,,,,,WOS:000456690800014,View Full Record in Web of Science

We found that the scale of synchrony was approximately 400 km when all available data were utilized; much greater than the 50-km scale suggested for freshwater fish populations in an earlier global analysis. The presence of recruitment synchrony between Great Lakes and inland lake cisco populations supports the hypothesis that synchronicity is driven by climate and not dispersal. We also found synchrony in larval densities among three Lake Superior populations separated by 25-275 km, which further supports the hypothesis that broad-scale climatic factors are the cause of spatial synchrony. Among several candidate climate variables measured during the period of larval cisco emergence, maximum wind speeds exhibited the most similar spatial scale of synchrony to that observed for cisco. Other factors, such as average water temperatures, exhibited synchrony on broader spatial scales, which suggests they could also be contributing to recruitment synchrony. Our results provide evidence that abiotic factors can induce synchronous patterns of recruitment for populations of cisco inhabiting waters across a broad geographic range, and show that broad-scale synchrony of recruitment can occur in freshwater fish populations as well as those from marine systems.

Yet a synthesis is still lacking. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of relevant experiments and examined how dispersal affected spatial synchrony and temporal population variability across scales. Our analyses showed that dispersal generally promoted spatial synchrony, and such effects increased with dispersal rate and decreased with environmental correlation among patches. The synchronizing effect of dispersal, however, was detected only when spatial synchrony was measured using the correlation-based index, not when the covariance-based index was used. In contrast to theoretical predictions, the effect of dispersal on local population variability was generally nonsignificant, except when environmental correlation among patches was negative and/or the experimental period was long. At the regional scale, while low dispersal stabilized metapopulation dynamics, high dispersal led to destabilization. Overall, the sign and strength of dispersal effects on spatial synchrony and population variability were modulated by taxa, environmental heterogeneity, type of perturbations, patch number, and experimental length.

Investigations of synchrony in community ecology have tended to focus on covariance in the abundances of multiple species in a single location. Yet, the importance of regional environmental variation and spatial processes in community dynamics suggests that community properties, such as species richness, could fluctuate synchronously across patches in a metacommunity, in an analog of population spatial synchrony. Here, we test the prevalence of this phenomenon and the conditions under which it may occur using theoretical simulations and empirical data from 20 marine and terrestrial metacommunities. Additionally, given the importance of biodiversity for stability of ecosystem function, we posit that spatial synchrony in species richness is strongly related to stability. Our findings show that metacommunities often exhibit spatial synchrony in species richness. We also found that richness synchrony can be driven by environmental stochasticity and dispersal, two mechanisms of population spatial synchrony. Richness synchrony also depended on community structure, including species evenness and beta diversity. Strikingly, ecosystem stability was more strongly related to richness synchrony than to species richness itself, likely because richness synchrony integrates information about community processes and environmental forcing.

By synthesising and extending prior work, we show how geography of synchrony, a term which we use to refer to detailed spatial variation in patterns of synchrony, can be leveraged to understand ecological processes including identification of drivers of synchrony, a long-standing challenge. We focus on three main objectives: (1) showing conceptually and theoretically four mechanisms that can generate geographies of synchrony; (2) documenting complex and pronounced geographies of synchrony in two important study systems; and (3) demonstrating a variety of methods capable of revealing the geography of synchrony and, through it, underlying organism ecology. For example, we introduce a new type of network, the synchrony network, the structure of which provides ecological insight.

Understanding the connection between patterns of recruitment and environmental forcing has major implications for the conservation and management of marine ecosystems. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that dispersal and regional variability in environmental conditions may synchronize distant populations and generate patterns of spatial synchrony (i.e. decay in synchrony with distance). Here, we submit that recruitment synchrony patterns may be used to identify processes shaping the distribution of marine populations. We used artificial substrates to estimate patterns of spatial synchrony in recruitment for 15 intertidal invertebrates at 16 exposed rocky platforms spanning 120 km of the central coast of Chile. Clear and significant synchrony patterns were found for only 4 species: the barnacles Jehlius cirratus, Notochthamalus scabrosus, and Notobalanus flosculus, and the bivalve Perumytilus purpuratus, all of which occur at comparatively high abundance across the study region. The strength of synchrony decayed with distance, from positively correlated fluctuations for sites separated by < 30 km, to negatively correlated for sites > 40 km apart. Patterns of spatial synchrony in recruitment resembled those of fluctuations in sea surface temperature, suggesting that mesoscale processes such as coastal upwelling may shape recruitment patterns by way of modulating larval dispersal. A lack of clear synchrony patterns in the remaining species could be ascribed to their low abundance, or, for those with potentially limited larval dispersal (e.g. direct development), it could indicate our lack of adequate spatio-temporal resolution to detect recruitment variability at small scales.",,,,,"Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013","Tapia, Fabian/0000-0001-9661-6069; Navarrete, Sergio Andres/0000-0003-4021-3863",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,,,,,,2007,350,,,,,,29,39,,10.3354/meps07105,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps07105,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000251948500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In metapopulations, dispersal can act as a 'double edged' sword for species stability by simultaneously decreasing local population variability (thereby decreasing local extinction risk) while increasing spatial synchrony (thereby increasing landscape-level extinction risk). These dynamics may operate at different timescales, complicating efforts to assess their relative importance for long-term stability. Here, we use a simple metapopulation model to understand how dispersal affects population variability and spatial synchrony across timescales. Our model shows that dispersal has contrasting effects at short versus long timescales on the variability and synchrony of populations. For populations that exhibit slow recovery when perturbed (i.e. under-compensatory growth), dispersal decreases local population variability while increasing spatial synchrony at long timescales. In contrast, at short timescales dispersal increases local population variability while decreasing spatial synchrony. For populations that recover via damped oscillation when perturbed (i.e. over-compensatory growth), the effects of dispersal are all opposite to those for populations with under-compensatory growth, at both short and long timescales. The timescale-dependent effect of dispersal has important implications for empirical studies. Specifically, studies conducted over short periods may only observe population variability increasing and spatial synchrony decreasing with dispersal, whereas the opposite patterns may predominate over longer periods.

The importance of baseflow, rainfall deficits, soil moisture deficits and high temperatures in triggering streamflow droughts is also investigated to identify the dominant driver during the period 1981-2015. Spatial synchrony of streamflow droughts is investigated using multivariate Ripley's K function and temporal clustering is evaluated using univariate Ripley's K at various timescales. The interactions of streamflow droughts with potential causative processes are investigated using event coincidence analysis. At regional scale, streamflow droughts in peninsular catchments show strong spatial synchrony even at longer timescales. However, at basin scale, droughts in the catchments show strong spatial synchrony only at smaller timescales, behave independently of each other and achieve asynchrony with time, especially at longer timescales. Streamflow droughts show the strongest temporal clustering at smaller timescales and the strength of clustering decreases after a 3 year timescale.

In this study, we developed a spatially structured population model, which is described by coupled-map lattices. Our recent investigation showed that trophic correlation of environmental noise was another important factor that affects spatial synchrony. As a supplement, we considered the influence of the color of the environmental noise on the spatial synchrony in this study. The noise color refers to the temporal correlation in the time series data of the noise, and is expressed as the degree of (first-order) autocorrelation for autoregressive noise. Patterns of spatial synchrony were considered for stable, periodic (quasi-periodic), and chaotic population dynamics. Numerical simulations verified that the color of the environmental noise is another mechanism that causes spatial synchrony. Generally, the effect of the color of the noise on the synchrony is dependent on the type of dynamics (stable, cyclic, chaotic) present in the population. For cyclic dynamics, simulation results clearly demonstrate that reddened noise has higher synchrony than white noise. The importance of our research is that it enriches the theory of potential causes of spatial synchrony.",,,,,"Gao, Meng/ITU-2991-2023","Liu, Zhiguang/0000-0002-1625-8298",,,,,,,,,,,,,0912-3814,1440-1703,,,,MAR,2009,24,2,,,,,383,392,,10.1007/s11284-008-0513-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-008-0513-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000263504100015,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Williams, DW; Liebhold, AM",,,,"Williams, DW; Liebhold, AM",,,Spatial synchrony of spruce budworm outbreaks in eastern North America,ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"We investigated the spatial synchrony of outbreaks of the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, over much of its outbreak range in eastern North America during the period 1945-1988. Spatial synchrony decreased with distance between local populations and approached zero near 2000 km. Investigation of the synchrony of local population time series with cluster analysis revealed a pattern of geographically distinct blocks of clusters oriented along an east-west axis. Spatial synchrony also was identified in monthly temperature and precipitation time series at 18 weather stations over the same time period and geographical range as the spruce budworm outbreaks. Cross correlations decreased linearly with distance between stations and approached zero near 3000 km and 1800 km, respectively. We developed a spatially explicit lattice model for a single species occupying multiple patches. Within patches, the model had first order logistic dynamics, and patches were linked by dispersal that depended upon their separation distances. Both local and regional stochasticity (i.e., a Moran effect) were present. The modeled lattice had the same spatial configuration as the outbreak region to facilitate investigating the relative effects of a Moran effect and dispersal on spatial synchrony. Simulations with and without a simple region-wide Moran effect and three levels of dispersal did not produce the decrease in spatial synchrony with distance observed with spruce budworm time series. However, when run at the highest dispersal rate, those simulations produced cluster maps similar to that observed for spruce budworm defoliation. Simulations with a spatially autocorrelated disturbance that had either zero or high local variability and three levels of dispersal produced decreases in spatial synchrony with distance similar to that observed in the historical data. When run at the highest dispersal rate, simulations yielded cluster maps similar to the cluster map for defoliation. We discuss the potential significance of the spatially autocorrelated disturbance factor in understanding regional insect outbreaks. We also consider the plausibility of dispersal rates used in our simulations. We suggest in conclusion that spruce budworm outbreaks were synchronized by a combination of a spatially autocorrelated Moran effect and a high dispersal rate.",,,,,"Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,OCT,2000,81,10,,,,,2753,2766,,10.2307/177339,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/177339,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000089970400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

This pattern is of great ecological interest and can be a source of concern when the species is rare or endangered. Both dispersal and spatial correlations in the environment have been implicated as possible causes of this pattern, but these two factors have rarely been studied in combination. We develop a spatially structured population model, simple enough to obtain analytic solutions for the population correlation, that incorporates both dispersal and environmental correlation. We ask whether these two synchronizing factors contribute additively to the total spatial population covariance. We find that there is always an interaction between these two factors and that this interaction is small only when one or both of the environmental correlation and the dispersal rate are small. The interaction is opposite in sign to the environmental correlation; so, in the normal case of positive environmental correlation across sires, the population synchrony will be lower than predicted by simply adding the effects of dispersal and environmental correlation.

Our results indicate that amber darter populations have declined substantially, with 9% annual losses in both the Conasauga and Etowah rivers, suggesting rangewide imperilment. Furthermore, model selection indicated little support for models with fully independent dynamics between rivers, which may compound overall extinction risk.

Subsidies are indicative of processes connecting ecosystems and can couple ecological dynamics across system boundaries. However, the degree to which such flows can induce cross-ecosystem cascades of spatial synchrony, the tendency for system fluctuations to be correlated across locations, is not well understood. Synchrony has destabilizing effects on ecosystems, adding to the importance of understanding spatiotemporal patterns of synchrony transmission. In order to understand whether and how spatial synchrony cascades across the marine-terrestrial boundary via resource subsidies, we studied the relationship between giant kelp forests on rocky nearshore reefs and sandy beach ecosystems that receive resource subsidies in the form of kelp wrack (detritus). We found that synchrony cascades from rocky reefs to sandy beaches, with spatiotemporal patterns mediated by fluctuations in live kelp biomass, wave action, and beach width. Moreover, wrack deposition synchronized local abundances of shorebirds that move among beaches seeking to forage on wrack-associated invertebrates, demonstrating that synchrony due to subsidies propagates across trophic levels in the recipient ecosystem. Synchronizing resource subsidies likely play an underappreciated role in the spatiotemporal structure, functioning, and stability of ecosystems. Significance Many ecosystems depend on resource inputs, called subsidies, from other ecosystems, influencing their structure and function. Using a model system, we demonstrate how resource subsidies can synchronize the dynamics of recipient ecosystems across space: Synchronous offshore kelp supply, mediated by wave action and beach width, yielded synchronous deposition of kelp wrack (detritus) on open coast sandy beaches, which then cascaded through the trophic levels of the terrestrial recipient system, synchronizing local abundances of shorebirds that move among beaches to forage on invertebrate wrack consumers.

These changes, driven by non-uniform climate change were observed on the regional scale. It is still unclear how spatial synchrony of the growing season on the climate gradient of the mid-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and ecoregions, has changed over the past decades. Therefore, we calculated the start, end, and length of the thermal growing season (SOS, EOS, and LOS, respectively), which are indicators of the theoretical plant growth season, based on the daily-mean temperature of the Princeton Global Forcing dataset from 1948 to 2016. Spatial variations in the SOS, EOS and LOS along spatial climate gradients were analyzed using the multivariate-linear regression model. The changes of spatial synchrony in the SOS, EOS and LOS were analyzed using the segmented model. The results showed that in all ecoregions, spatially, areas with higher temperature tended to have an earlier SOS, later EOS and longer LOS. However, not all the areas with higher precipitation tended to have a later SOS, later EOS, and shorter LOS. The spatial synchrony in the SOS decreased across the entire study area, whereas the EOS showed the opposite trend. Among the seven ecoregions, spatial synchrony in the SOS in temperate broadleaf/mixed forests and temperate conifer forests changed the most noticeably, decreasing in both regions. Conversely, spatial synchrony in the EOS in the taiga, temperate grasslands/savannas/shrublands and tundra changed the most noticeably, increasing in each region.

The two main nonexclusive hypotheses for the driver of such geographically extensive synchrony are (1) environmental factors (the Moran effect), and (2) the mutual dependence of trees on outcrossed pollen (pollen coupling). We tested 10 predictions relevant to these two hypotheses using 18 years of acorn production data on two species of California oaks. Data were obtained across the entire ranges of the two species at 12 sites (10 for each species) separated by up to 745 km. In general, our results provided strong support for the importance of the Moran effect as a driver of spatial synchrony in and between these two species. Particularly compelling was evidence of close concordance between spatial synchrony in acorn production and key environmental factors extending over the range of both species and significant spatial cross-synchrony between the two species, despite considerable differences in their geographical ecology. Because oaks are monoecious, female flowers are not necessarily related to pollen production, and thus, our tests do not address the role of pollen coupling in bisexual species where pollen and flower production are necessarily correlated.

The most commonly suggested mechanisms to explain Spatial synchrony include dispersal, and regional stochasticity (i.e., the Moran effect). We analyzed landscape-scale historical outbreak data for six forest insect species: spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), western spruce budworm (C. occidentalis), larch bud moth (Zeiraphera diniana), forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). We used a recently developed statistical method (the nonparametric covariance function) for quantifying the magnitude and spatial range of synchrony in both outbreak and corresponding weather data. The varying dispersal capabilities of the species enabled us to speculate on the relative importance of dispersal vs. the Moran effect as potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns. Our results indicated that spatial synchrony was not directly associated with dispersal capabilities at the spatial scales considered. In contrast, the spatial correlation in weather variables was high enough to account for the levels of synchrony observed in the outbreak data. Therefore, the Moran effect appeared to be the more dominant process affecting the spatial dynamics of these species at the landscape scale. In general, however, the synchrony in outbreaks declined more steeply with geographical distance than the correlation in the weather variables, breaking with the predictions of Moran's theorem. A more detailed analysis of gypsy moth outbreak data showed that local dynamics varied considerably in a spatially dependent manner. The existence of such variation violates one of the assumptions of the Moran's theorem, namely, that the dynamic properties of disjunct populations are identical. We used a simple theoretical model to demonstrate that such geographical variation in local population dynamics may indeed force synchrony to decline more rapidly with distance than the correlation in the environment.",,,,,"Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008; Bjornstad, Ottar/I-4518-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,NOV,2002,83,11,,,,,3120,3129,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[3120:SSIFIO]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[3120:SSIFIO]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000179624600019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Spatial synchrony was observed in all analyses, but was particularly great among eastern summer populations and among overwintering populations on the Pacific Coast. Thus, in a year when relatively large numbers of monarchs were found at a particular breeding or wintering site in these populations, other sites within a wide area were likely to have relatively large numbers of monarchs as well. Spatial structure, measured by the decline in synchrony with distance, was relatively strong among summer populations in eastern North America, weaker, but present, among western Summering populations and virtually nonexistent among overwintering populations along the Pacific Coast. Spatial synchrony in mean temperatures during the relevant time periods was generally much greater than that observed in the monarchs, consistent with the hypothesis that environmental factors (the Moran effect) may be playing a central role in causing the observed population sync,irony. However, differences in spatial structure between monarch populations and mean temperature during the summer suggest that other factors, possibly post-migratory dispersal, are also affecting synchrony.

This phenomenon is often due to the spatial synchrony/asynchrony. Those indices that are asynchronous may result in discrepancies in the assessment of temporal trends. In addition, commonly employed stock assessment models, such as the statistical catch-at-age (SCA) models, do not account for spatial synchrony/asynchrony associated with spatial autocorrelation, dispersal, and environmental noise. This limits the value of statistical inference on key parameters associated with population dynamics and management reference points. To address this problem, a set of geospatial analyses of relative abundance indices is proposed to model the indices from different surveys using spatial hierarchical Bayesian models. This approach allows better integration of different surveys with spatial synchrony and asynchrony. We used Atlantic weakfish (Cynoscion regalis) as an example for which there are state-wide surveys and expansive coastal surveys. We further compared the performance of the proposed spatially structured hierarchical Bayesian SCA models with a commonly used Bayesian SCA model that assumes relative abundance indices are spatially independent. Three spatial models developed to mimic different potential spatial patterns were compared. The random effect spatially structured hierarchical Bayesian model was found to be better than the commonly used SCA model and the other two spatial models. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the uncertainty resulting from model selection and the robustness of the recommended model. The spatially structured hierarchical Bayesian model was shown to be able to integrate different survey indices with/without spatial synchrony.

Understanding factors influencing this synchrony may shed light on important drivers of population dynamics. Three mechanisms influence the degree of spatial synchrony between populations: dispersal, shared predators, and spatial environmental covariance (the Moran effect). We assessed demographic spatial synchrony in recruitment (calf:cow ratio) of 10 northern mountain caribou herds in the Yukon Territory, Canada (1982-2008). Shared predators and dispersal were ruled out as causal mechanisms of spatial recruitment synchrony in these herds and therefore any spatial synchrony should be due to the Moran effect. We also assessed the degree of spatial synchrony in April snow depth to represent environmental variability. The regional average spatial synchrony in detrended residuals of April snow depth was 0.46 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.55). Spatial synchrony in caribou recruitment was weak at 0.13 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.32). The spatial scale of synchrony in April snow depth and caribou recruitment was 330.2 km (95% CI 236.3 to 370.0 km) and 170.0 km (95% CI 69.5 to 282.8 km), respectively. We also investigated how the similarity in terrain features between herds influenced the degree of spatial synchrony using exponential decay models. Only the difference in elevation variability between herds during calving was supported by the data. Herds with more similar elevation variability may track snowmelt ablation patterns in a more similar fashion, which would subsequently result in more synchronized predation rates on calves and/or nutritional effects impacting juvenile survival.

Population peaks and mass outbreaks typically occur synchronously and may lead to extensive forest damages over large geographic areas. Here, we report patterns of spatial synchrony among cyclic autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) populations across Fennoscandia, as inferred from 24 long-term (10-33 years) data sets. The study provides the first formal analysis of spatial synchrony of this pest species which damages mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) forests in the sub Arctic. We detected positive cross-correlations in population growth rates between the time series, indicating overall spatial synchrony. However, we found the strongest degree of synchrony within geographically and climatically distinct regional clusters, into which time series were partitioned using cluster analyses. Within regional clusters, moth populations were exposed to the synchronizing effects of common, spatially autocorrelated environmental conditions, i.e. a Moran effect. Consequently, we conclude that a geographically and climatically restricted Moran effect, perhaps interacting with dispersal, is the most likely explanation for the regionally partitioned pattern of synchrony among autumnal moth populations in Fennoscandia.

A common mechanism of spatial synchrony is the Moran effect, whereby spatially synchronized environmental signals drive population dynamics and hence induce population synchrony. After reviewing recent progress in understanding Moran effects, we here elaborate a general theory of how Moran effects of different environmental drivers acting on the same populations can interact, either synergistically or destructively, to produce either substantially more or markedly less population synchrony than would otherwise occur. We provide intuition for how this newly recognized mechanism works through theoretical case studies and application of our theory to California populations of giant kelp.

In this study, we focus on factors determining population fluctuations and spatial synchrony in the Siberian flying squirrel, Pteromys volans, using long-term monitoring data from 16 Finnish populations located 2-400 km apart. We found an indication of synchronous population dynamics on a large scale in flying squirrels. However, the synchrony was not found to be clearly related to distance between study sites because the populations seemed to be strongly affected by small-scale local factors. The regularity of population fluctuations varied over time. The fluctuations were linked to changes in winter precipitation, which has previously been linked to the reproductive success of flying squirrels. Food abundance (tree mast) and predator abundance were not related to population fluctuations in this study.

This phenomenon has been documented in the dynamics of species representing a variety of taxa and ecological roles. Synchrony may arise from three primary mechanisms: (a) dispersal among populations, reducing the size of relatively large populations and increasing relatively small ones; (b) congruent dependence of population dynamics on a synchronous exogenous random factor such as temperature or rainfall, a phenomenon known as the Moran effect; and (c) trophic interactions with populations of other species that are themselves spatially synchronous or mobile. Identification of the causes of synchrony is often difficult. In addition to intraspecific synchrony, there are many examples of synchrony among populations of different species, the causes of which are similarly complex and difficult to identify.

The dynamics of the food chain are depicted by both the Hastings-Powell model and the chemostat model, with synchrony measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. We use the density-independent dispersal in the system as a baseline for comparison. Results show that the density-independent dispersal of a species in the system can promote its dynamic synchrony. Dispersal of intermediate species in the tri-trophic food chain is the strongest synchronizer. In contrast, the density-dependent PP and PE of intermediate species can desynchronize the system.

In an attempt to ascertain the effect of environmental change on the decline of the species we also look for evidence of climate changes in the breeding and wintering area of this shrike and related effects on vegetation by using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We found that the interannual fluctuations of the peripheral populations in France and Spain are strongly correlated, therefore suggesting that their decline can be under the influence of a common factor. We obtained clear evidence of climatic change (an increased thermal oscillation) in one peripheral population that could have resulted in a decrease of the NDVI index in the area.

Investigations into the geography of synchrony can provide useful insight to inform conservation planning efforts by revealing regions of common population drivers and metapopulation extinction vulnerability. We examined the geography of spatial synchrony and decadal changes in these patterns for grassland birds in the United States and Canada, which are experiencing widespread and persistent population declines. We used Bayesian hierarchical models and over 50 years of abundance data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to generate population indices within a 2 degrees latitude by 2 degrees longitude grid. We computed and mapped mean local spatial synchrony for each cell (mean detrended correlation of the index among neighboring cells), along with associated uncertainty, for 19 species in 2, 26-year periods, 1968-1993 and 1994-2019. Grassland birds were predicted to increase in spatial synchrony where agricultural intensification, climate change, or interactions between the 2 increased. We found no evidence of an overall increase in synchrony among grassland bird species. However, based on the geography of these changes, there was considerable spatial heterogeneity within species. Averaging across species, we identified clusters of increasing spatial synchrony in the Prairie Pothole and Shortgrass Prairie regions and a region of decreasing spatial synchrony in the eastern United States. Our approach has the potential to inform continental-scale conservation planning by adding an additional layer of relevant information to species status assessments and spatial prioritization of policy and management actions.

We present an analysis of Myzus persicae population dynamics with and without neonicotinoid seed treatment. We use 6 years' yellow water trap and field-collected aphid data and two decades of 12.2 m suction-trap aphid migration data. We investigate both spatial synchrony and forecasting error to understand the structure and spatial scale of field counts and why forecasting aphid migrants lacks accuracy. Our aim is to derive statistical parameters to inform regionwide pest management strategies. ResultsSpatial synchrony, indicating the coincident change in counts across the region over time, is rarely present and is best described as stochastic. Uniquely, early season field populations in 2019 did show spatial synchrony to 90 km compared to the overall average weekly correlation length of 23 km. However, 70% of the time series were spatially heterogenous, indicating patchy between-field dynamics. Field counts lacked the same seasonal trend and did not peak in the same week. Forecasts tended to under-predict mid-season log(10) counts. A strongly negative correlation between forecasting error and the proportion of zeros was shown. ConclusionField populations are unpredictable and stochastic, regardless of neonicotinoid seed treatment.

Yet experimental studies evaluating how changes in disturbance regimes affect the synchrony and stability of populations and communities remain rare. We hypothesized that spatially heterogeneous disturbances of moderate intensity would promote metacommunity stability by decreasing the spatial synchrony of species fluctuations. To test this hypothesis, we exposed rocky shore communities of algae and invertebrates to homogeneous and gradient-like spatial patterns of disturbance at two levels of intensity for 4 years and used synchrony networks to characterize community responses to these disturbances. The gradient-like disturbance at low intensity enhanced spatial beta diversity compared to the other treatments and produced the most heterogeneous and least synchronized network, which was also the most stable in terms of population and community fluctuations. In contrast, homogeneous disturbance destabilized the community, enhancing spatial synchronization. Intense disturbances always reduced spatial beta diversity, indicating that strong perturbations could destabilize communities via biotic homogenization regardless of their spatial structure. Our findings corroborated theoretical predictions, emphasizing the importance of spatially heterogeneous disturbances in promoting stability by amplifying asynchronous spatial and temporal fluctuations in population and community abundance. In contrast to other networks, synchrony networks are vulnerable to the removal of most peripheral nodes, which are less synchronized, but may contribute more to stability than other nodes by dampening large fluctuations in species abundance. Our findings suggest that climate change and direct anthropogenic disturbance can compromise the stability of ecological communities through combined effects on diversity and synchrony, as well as further affecting ecosystems through habitat loss.",,,,,"Mintrone, Caterina/KIJ-0881-2024; Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/J-8225-2019","Mintrone, Caterina/0000-0001-8801-0067; Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/0000-0001-5244-5202; Rindi, Luca/0000-0002-2279-4214",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,MAR,2024,105,3,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.4246,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.4246,,JAN 2024,,,,,,38286517,,,,,WOS:001151656100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We conducted a field experiment in western Finland to evaluate the relative roles of these mechanisms in inducing spatial synchrony among cyclic populations of field voles Microtus agrestis. The study was conducted during the increase and peak phases of a vole population cycle on four agricultural field sites situated 1.5-7.0 km apart. Each field contained two 0.5-ha fenced enclosures and one 1-ha unfenced control area. One enclosure per field allowed access by small mustelid predators and the other by avian predators; all enclosures prevented the dispersal of voles. The unfenced control areas allowed access by all predators as well as dispersal by voles. Enclosed vole populations were in a treatment-wise asynchronous phase before the predator access treatments were applied. The growth rates of all enclosed populations were tightly synchronized during the course of the experiment. Conversely, synchrony both among the unfenced populations and between the fenced and unfenced populations was practically non-existent. During winter, in the increase phase of the cycle, vole populations in all treatments declined to low densities due to a seasonal effect of winter food depletion. During summer, in the peak year of the vole cycle, all populations fluctuated in synchrony. At this time, both small mustelids and birds of prey appeared to be abundant enough to induce synchrony. Dispersal was identified as a potential contributor to synchronization, but the magnitude of its effects could not be reliably discerned. Our results indicate that no single mechanism can account for the observed patterns of spatial synchrony among cyclic northern vole populations. Rather, spatial synchronization is induced by different mechanisms, namely seasonality and predation, acting successively during different seasons and phases of the vole cycle.",,,,,"Korpimäki, Erkki/JED-5831-2023; Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Huitu, Otso/0000-0003-3829-1213",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,JUN,2005,109,3,,,,,583,593,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13476.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13476.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000227722400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to the spatially complex and dynamic nature of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forests, assessment of the abundances of giant kelp and amphipods through time and space should provide insight into their potential interactions within the system. In an extensive field study within the surface canopy of giant kelp, the abundance of amphipods was quantified on artificial substrates at an array of 18 sites within kelp forests along Point Loma, California, USA, from July to October 2009 and 2010. Biomass of giant kelp canopy was estimated using remotely sensed imagery, and the spatial synchrony (autocorrelation through time) of kelp canopy was compared with synchrony of caprellid and non-caprellid amphipods. Caprellids exhibited high spatial synchrony that did not decrease with distance, while non-caprellids were synchronous on local scales, indicating high spatial heterogeneity in abundance through time. Gammarids showed a rapid exponential decrease in synchrony within the first 550 m that was consistent with synchrony of giant kelp. This suggests a local-scale biotic link between non-caprellids and giant kelp canopy, whereas caprellid synchrony is more likely to be influenced by regional-scale environmental variables. Caprellids and other amphipods are important prey resources for common kelp forest fishes, so these differences may in turn affect the spatial distributions of these predators. Moreover, excretion by amphipods may be an important source of nitrogen to giant kelp during periods of nitrogen limitation.",,,,,"Bell, Tom/AAD-2551-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,FEB,2016,163,2,,,,,,,32,10.1007/s00227-015-2807-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-015-2807-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000370052700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evaluating the spatial synchrony of populations and environmental variables in the development of reservoirs may reveal determinant factors and processes operating in these ecosystems. This may help understand the impacts, optimize monitoring systems and develop strategies to improve and maintain the ecological integrity (or stability) of these environments. In this study, we evaluated the spatial synchrony in zooplankton populations and limnological environmental variables during the implementation of a hydroelectric reservoir in the Amazon region, on the border of the states of Para and Amapa. Synchrony was determined by mean cross-correlation between the pairs of points for each variable, followed by Mantel test to investigate its influencing factors. We observed spatial synchronous values for both population and limnological environmental variables. However, we could not identify the mechanisms that are operating, indicating that more than one factor may be influencing the ecosystem dynamics. Population synchrony increased after impoundment. Population synchrony may be associated with some limnological variables, such as the ones related to the amounts of nutrients, whereas environmental synchrony can be related to extrinsic factors, such as climatic variation, not tested this study. In order to increase the understanding of the mechanisms operating over population and environmental dynamics, we suggest that, besides evaluating limnological environmental variables and spatial synchrony, analyses should include meteorological and landscape data.",,,,,"Carvalho Vieira, Maisa/C-9398-2018; Velho, Luiz Felipe Machado/I-9130-2016; Cardoso Galli Vieira, Ludgero/G-6985-2017","Carvalho Vieira, Maisa/0000-0002-8787-7627; Velho, Luiz Felipe Machado/0000-0001-8111-4955; Cardoso Galli Vieira, Ludgero/0000-0002-9411-6666",,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,MAR,2019,98,,,,,,649,656,,10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.11.040,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.11.040,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000464891100065,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, we addressed these questions: Does Lyme disease incidence exhibit spatial synchrony? If so, what geographic patterns does Lyme disease synchrony exhibit? Are geographic patterns of disease synchrony related to weather, land cover, access to health care, or tick-borne disease awareness? How do effects of these variables on Lyme disease synchrony differ geographically? We used network analysis and matrix regression to examine geographical patterns of Lyme disease synchrony and their potential mechanisms in 399 counties in the eastern and Midwestern US.

In sheltered areas, kelp declines synchronously (lower-tail dependence) when waves are relatively intense, because waves below a certain height do little damage to kelp.

Numerous studies have reported varying levels of spatial synchrony among closely-related species, suggesting that species' characteristics may play a role in determining the level of synchrony. However, few studies have attempted to relate this synchrony to the ecological characteristics and/or life-history traits of species. Yet, as to some extent the extinction risk may be related to synchrony patterns, identifying a link between species' characteristics and spatial synchrony is crucial, and would help us to define effective conservation planning. Here, we investigated whether species attributes and temperature synchrony (i.e. a proxy of the Moran effect) account for the differences in spatial population synchrony observed in 27 stream fish species in France. After measuring and testing the level of synchrony for each species, we performed a comparative analysis to detect the phylogenetic signal of these levels, and to construct various multi-predictor models with species traits and temperature synchrony as covariates, while taking phylogenetic relatedness into account. We then performed model averaging on selected models to take model uncertainty into account in our parameter estimates. Fifteen of the 27 species displayed a significant level of synchrony. Synchrony was weak, but highly variable between species, and was not conserved across the phylogeny. We found that some species' characteristics significantly influenced synchrony levels. Indeed, the average model indicated that species associated with greater dispersal abilities, lower thermal tolerance, and opportunistic strategy displayed a higher degree of synchrony. These findings indicate that phylogeny and spatial temperature synchrony do not provide information pertinent for explaining the variations in species' synchrony levels, whereas the dispersal abilities, the life-history strategies and the upper thermal tolerance limits of species do appear to be quite reliable predictors of synchrony levels.",,,,,"chevalier, mathieu/AAU-6540-2020; Grenouillet, Gael/E-6518-2019","Chevalier, Mathieu/0000-0002-1170-5343; Grenouillet, Gael/0000-0003-3588-3694",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,OCT,2014,37,10,,,,,960,968,,10.1111/ecog.00662,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.00662,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000342613600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This pattern is caused mainly by dispersal and spatially correlated environmental stochasticity. The levels of spatial synchrony can vary between species, yet little is known about which species traits can explain this interspecific variation. In addition, traits may have different degrees of influence on spatial synchrony levels because of their differences in plasticity. We hypothesized that conservative traits-reproductive and morphological-will best explain interspecific variation in synchrony, while those that may vary according to the environment-feeding and habitat preference-will be weakly related to this interspecific variation. We evaluated the spatial synchrony of freshwater fish species in a highly fragmented river in the Neotropical region and related the levels of synchrony to seven predictors: diet, reproductive traits (migration, fecundation, parental care and spawning), position in the water column, niche breadth, body size, body shape and average temporal occurrence of each species. The fish species showed low levels of spatial synchrony but a high interspecific variation (correlation values ranging from -0.11 to 0.41). We found that this variation was mainly related to species' reproductive traits, that is, sedentary species with partial spawning and without parental care had higher mean spatial synchrony than species with the opposite characteristics. In contrast, more plastic traits (diet and habitat preferences) were poor predictors of mean spatial synchrony. We speculate that, despite the low spatial synchrony found, if extreme impacts continue to occur in the basin at the regional scale, it may negatively affect local fish populations in a synchronous manner, resulting in increased risk of simultaneous declines.",,,,,"Rodrigues, Amanda/AAD-5710-2020; Bini, Luis/D-5865-2013; Granzotti, Rafaela/S-6523-2017; Gomes, Luiz/D-5886-2013; Severi, William/G-1836-2012","Santos, Natalia/0000-0001-6538-0196; Rodrigues, Amanda Cantarute/0000-0002-3394-1865; Severi, William/0000-0001-8873-5965; Vendrametto Granzotti, Rafaela/0000-0002-4128-2468",,,,,,,,,,,,,1442-9985,1442-9993,,,,DEC,2022,47,8,,,,,1636,1651,,10.1111/aec.13241,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.13241,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000868727200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The concept of spatial synchrony in ecology refers to the presence of coordinated time fluctuations in certain characteristics that can be observed in plant and animal communities inhabiting an area. It is a well-known phenomenon common to virtually every taxon, but comparatively little attention has been given to the study of the temporal coherence of forest tree performance across biogeographical gradients. In forest ecosystems, tree growth dynamics is primarily driven by climatic variability (i.e., the Moran effect). Due to rapid climate change, trees are increasingly pushed to their physiological limits up to the level that many populations are facing immediate risk of extinction. The characterization of synchrony patterns in tree growth can provide clues on the relevance of emerging climatic threats on forests, as new combinations of precipitation and temperature are entraining tree performance worldwide. In this regard, comprehensive and systematic approaches to analyse spatiotemporal dynamics of tree growth are needed. Here, we present a methodology for disentangling and interpreting how the variability and common signal strength of tree growth (or other traits) are structured in tree-ring networks. It is grounded on mixed modelling principles and broadens well-known theoretical principles in dendrosciences.

The effect of several types of wetland variables (structural, hydroperiod and landscape) on spatial synchronization was explored. Groups of lakes with significant synchronization were identified for all three species. The lakes with wastewater input presented longer hydroperiods than those that did not receive these effluents, and this factor was positively related to the spatial synchrony of the Pied Avocet and Kentish Plover populations. The distance between lakes (used as an indicator of the dispersal effect on synchronization) was significant only in Pied Avocet. No structural or landscape variables were related to spatial synchronization in any species. It was impossible to identify any variable related to the spatial synchronization of Black-winged Stilt abundance as a possible result of the high ecological plasticity of this species.

SWD abundance was monitored every 2 weeks during the growing season (from June to November 2015) when cultivated and wild hosts are potentially susceptible (i.e. fruits are ripe). 3. Spotted wing drosophila were widely distributed along all the tested elevations, revealing synchrony in population dynamics across ranges in elevation and geographic distance. Synchronised populations were observed at distances of up to 100 km at sites with similar temperatures. The high dispersal potential of the pest together with the seasonal variation in temperature are likely to be the dominant mechanisms causing the observed spatial synchrony. A factor that seemed to reduce synchrony is the large concentration of host plants (i.e. crop) in lowland agricultural landscapes. 4. The spatial synchrony in pest abundance at large spatial scale indicates that the risk of SWD outbreaks is highly dependent on drivers beyond the control of traditional field-scale management. These findings could help in developing monitoring and predictive models of SWD population dynamics.",,,,,"Santoiemma, Giacomo/J-7169-2019; Marini, Lorenzo/B-1119-2009","Santoiemma, Giacomo/0000-0002-3226-9253; Marini, Lorenzo/0000-0001-7429-7685",,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,APR,2019,44,2,,,,,182,189,,10.1111/een.12688,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.12688,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000460077500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two processes that could have major effects on the spatial synchrony of wild population dynamics are density dependence and variation in environmental conditions like temperature. Understanding these effects is crucial for predicting the effects of climate change on local and regional population dynamics.We quantified the direct contribution of local temperature and density dependence to spatial synchrony in the population dynamics of nine fish species inhabiting the Barents Sea. First, we estimated the degree to which the annual spatial autocorrelations in density are influenced by temperature. Second, we estimated and mapped the local effects of temperature and strength of density dependence on annual changes in density. Finally, we measured the relative effects of temperature and density dependence on the spatial synchrony in changes in density.Temperature influenced the annual spatial autocorrelation in density more in species with greater affinities to the benthos and to warmer waters. Temperature correlated positively with changes in density in the eastern Barents Sea for most species. Temperature had a weak synchronizing effect on density dynamics, while increasing strength of density dependence consistently desynchronised the dynamics.Quantifying the relative effects of different processes affecting population synchrony is important to better predict how population dynamics might change when environmental conditions change. Here, high degrees of spatial synchrony in the population dynamics remained unexplained by local temperature and density dependence, confirming the presence of additional synchronizing drivers, such as trophic interactions or harvesting. Disentangling the processes affecting spatial synchrony is challenging but essential to predict the effects of changing environmental conditions on populations.

However, synchronising and desynchronising mechanisms can act at multiple spatial scales, which means that for wide-ranging species, patterns of spatial synchrony and their causes might vary across the species' range. We examined the relationships of spatial autocorrelation in winter climate, dispersal distance and predator management to the spatio-temporal dynamics of the Western Snowy Plover Charadrius nivosus nivosus, a threatened shorebird that breeds along the Pacific coast of the United States. We investigated how signals and drivers of plover population growth dynamics vary among populations occupying northern, central, and southern regions of the species' U.S. range. Across the metapopulation and specifically the core of the species' range in the south, we found that plover populations within 132 km of each other exhibited detectable levels of synchrony, which fell within published estimates of dispersal distance. Furthermore, similar predator management among sites increased the degree to which nearby populations were synchronised. There was, however, no evidence of spatial synchrony in populations of the northern and central regions. Regional differences in synchrony were associated with different population drivers and structure; prolonged cold periods had the strongest influence on the growth of northern populations while predator management had the strongest influence on southern populations. Northern populations were also smaller than the south, which likely reduced our ability to detect spatial synchrony because of increased demographic stochasticity. Neither climatic nor management variables had a detectable influence on central populations. Although the primary objective of threatened and endangered species management is to increase populations to viable levels, we recommend that conservation biologists and land managers acknowledge region-specific processes when considering the long-term persistence of wide-ranging species and coordinate inter-agency efforts to manage neighbouring populations effectively.",,,,,"Eberhart-Hertel, Luke/H-7894-2019","Eberhart-Hertel, Luke/0000-0001-7311-6088",,,,,,,,,,,,,0959-2709,1474-0001,,,,MAR,2016,26,1,,,,,119,135,,10.1017/S0959270914000379,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0959270914000379,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000372519600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The first comprehensive framework applied to spatial synchrony was probably the one elaborated by P. A. P. Moran back in 1953. He suggested that if two populations have the same linear density-dependent structure, the correlation between them will be equal to that between the local density-independent conditions. Surprisingly, the consequences of violating the assumption that the dynamics of the populations are identical has received little attention. In this paper, making the assumption that population dynamics can be described by linear and stationary autoregressive processes, I show that the observed spatial synchrony between two populations can be decomposed into two multiplicative components: the demographic component depending on the values of the autoregressive coefficients, and the correlation of the environmental noise. The Moran theorem corresponds to the special case where the demographic component equals unity. Using published data, I show that the spatial variability in population dynamics may substantially contribute to the spatial variability of population synchrony, and thus should not be neglected in future studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,OCT,2006,115,1,,,,,3,14,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14686.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14686.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000240998300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, ecologists have begun gleaning the relative roles of these by testing the predictions of neutral theory, which predicts the properties of communities under pure fitness equalization. This null hypothesis was rejected for forests of southern Ontario based on large-scale (similar to 100 km) spatial synchrony evident in the fossil pollen record over the entire Holocene, and the argument that a species' relative abundance would instead vary independently at such distances in the absence of stabilizing mechanisms. This test of neutral theory was criticized based on the idea that the synchrony might be produced by dispersal alone. Here, I revisit this test of neutral theory by explicitly calculating the synchrony expected in these forests using a novel simulation method enabling examination of the distribution of a species over large spatial and temporal scales. A novel neutral simulation algorithm tracking only the focal species was used to calculate the neutral expectation for spatial synchrony properties examined empirically by Clark and MacLachlan [(2003) Stability of forest biodiversity. Nature 423:635-8] using fossil pollen data from eight lake sites. The coefficient of variation (CV) in a species' relative abundance across the eight sites (initiated at about 10% with a small CV) was calculated for 10 runs over a 10 000 year time interval. The CV reflects the level of spatial synchrony in that less synchronous dynamics should lead to more variation across space (a higher equilibrium CV), and in particular, a greater increase in the CV over time from a small initial value. A 'two dimensional t' fat-tailed dispersal kernel was assumed with parameters set to the median derived from seed trap data for deciduous wind-dispersed trees. Robustness of results to assumed dispersal distance, density of trees on the landscape, site sizes, age at maturity and starting spatial distribution were checked. In contrast to the prediction of Clark and MacLachlan that, in the absence of stabilization, the CV across the sites should increase over time from levels observed at the beginning of the Holocene, under fat-tailed dispersal my neutral model robustly predicted only a brief (50 years) and small increase in the CV. I conclude that purely fitness-equalized species coexistence cannot be rejected based on the observed lack of increase in the CV across the eight sites in southern Ontario over the Holocene. Synchronous variation in environmental factors could alternatively explain the observed synchrony without the need for stabilization. However, neither dispersal nor environmental synchrony seems likely explanations for the quick widespread recovery of Tsuga in the Holocene after its seeming decimation, likely due to a pest outbreak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1752-9921,1752-993X,,,,MAR,2012,5,1,,,SI,,52,63,,10.1093/jpe/rtr035,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtr035,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000299103600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two key biotic drivers of spatial synchrony have been identified: dispersal and trophic interactions (e.g. natural enemies). We used spatially structured, patchy bacterial populations to show that although increased dispersal always enhanced spatial synchrony of fluctuations in bacterial abundance, this effect was far stronger in the presence of a bacteriophage parasite. Bacteriophages drove strong within patch fluctuations in bacterial abundance that became phase locked through dispersal. Furthermore, the way in which stability, measured as constancy, responded to increasing dispersal was qualitatively different depending on whether parasites were present or not. Patch-level constancy decreased with dispersal in the presence of parasites, whereas dispersal increased patch-level constancy in the absence of parasites. Population-level constancy also decreased with dispersal in the presence of parasites, but was unaffected by dispersal in the absence of parasites. These contrasting patterns were likely due to the different role played by dispersal in the presence and absence of parasites, synchronizing dynamics in the former case and averaging stochastic fluctuations in the latter. Taken together, our findings suggest that dispersal and natural enemies can interact to drive spatially synchronous population fluctuations that decrease stability at both the patch and population level.",,,,,"Brockhurst, Michael/A-6247-2009; Fenton, Andy/B-5972-2009","Fenton, Andy/0000-0002-7676-917X; Vogwill, Tom/0000-0003-1044-6623; Brockhurst, Michael/0000-0003-0362-820X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1461-023X,1461-0248,,,,NOV,2009,12,11,,,,,1194,1200,,10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01374.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01374.x,,,,,,,,19719839,,,,,WOS:000270828100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dispersal among populations and synchronous stochastic effects (the so called Moran effect) are the mechanisms most likely to explain such synchrony patterns. Very few studies have related the degree of spatial synchrony to the biological characteristics of species. Here we present a case where specific predictions can be made to relate river fish species characteristics and synchrony determined exclusively by a Moran effect through the expected sensitivity of species to the regional component of environmental stochasticity. By analyzing 23-year time series of abundance estimates in two isolated localities we show that species associated with synchronized reproduction during the wet season, high fecundity, small egg size and high gonado-somatic index (the so called periodic strategy) have a higher degree of spatial synchrony in population dynamics than species associated with the opposite traits (the so called equilibrium strategy). This is supported by significant relationships (P values < 0.01) between species traits and the levels of synchrony after removing taxonomical relatedness. Spatial synchrony computed from summed annual total catches by groups of species, separated into strategy types also showed a significantly higher degree of synchrony for the periodic (r=0.83) than the equilibrium (r=0.46) group.

Our aims were to determine the spatial scale of intra- and interspecific synchrony of fluctuations in abundance of nine damselfish species ( genus Pomacentrus) and assess whether environmental factors could have influenced population synchrony. All species showed intraspecific synchrony among populations on reefs separated by <= 100 km, and interspecific synchrony was also common at this scale. At greater spatial scales, only four species showed intraspecific synchrony, over distances ranging from 100-300 km to 500-800 km, and no cases of interspecific synchrony were recorded. The two mechanisms most likely to cause population synchrony are dispersal and environmental forcing through regionally correlated climate ( the Moran effect). Dispersal may have influenced population synchrony over distances up to 100 km as this is the expected spatial range for ecologically significant reef fish dispersal. Environmental factors are also likely to have synchronized population fluctuations via the Moran effect for three reasons: ( 1) dispersal could not have caused interspecific synchrony that was common over distances <= 100 km because dispersal cannot link populations of different species, ( 2) variations in both sea surface temperature and wind speed were synchronized over greater spatial scales (>800 km) than fluctuations in damselfish abundance ( <= 800 km) and were correlated with an index of global climate variability, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO), and ( 3) synchronous population fluctuations of most damselfish species were correlated with ENSO; large population increases often followed ENSO events. We recorded regional variations in the strength of population synchrony that we suspect are due to spatial differences in geophysical, oceanographic, and population characteristics, which act to dilute or enhance the effects of synchronizing mechanisms. We conclude that synchrony is common among Pomacentrus populations separated by tens of kilometers but less prevalent at greater spatial scales, and that environmental variation linked to global climate is likely to be a driving force behind damselfish population synchrony at all spatial scales on the Great Barrier Reef.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JAN,2007,88,1,,,,,158,169,,10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[158:SSICRF]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[158:SSICRF]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,17489464,,,,,WOS:000245668300019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Generation and maintenance of synchrony requires forces that rapidly restore synchrony in the face of desynchronizing forces such as demographic and environmental stochasticity. One such force is dispersal, which couples local populations together, thereby synchronizing them. Theory predicts that average spatial synchrony can be a nonlinear function of dispersal rate, but the form of the dispersal rate-synchrony relationship has never been quantified for any system. Theory also predicts that in the presence of demographic and environmental stochasticity, realized levels of synchrony can exhibit high variability around the average, so that ecologically-identical metapopulations might exhibit very different levels of synchrony. We quantified the dispersal rate-synchrony relationship using a model system of protist predator-prey cycles in pairs of laboratory microcosms linked by different rates of dispersal. Paired predator-prey cycles initially were anti-synchronous, and were subject to demographic stochasticity and spatially-uncorrelated temperature fluctuations, challenging the ability of dispersal to rapidly synchronize them. Mean synchrony of prey cycles was a nonlinear, saturating function of dispersal rate. Even extremely low rates of dispersal (<0.4% per prey generation) were capable of rapidly bringing initially anti-synchronous cycles into synchrony. Consistent with theory, ecologically-identical replicates exhibited very different levels of prey synchrony, especially at low to intermediate dispersal rates. Our results suggest that even the very low rates of dispersal observed in many natural systems are sufficient to generate and maintain synchrony of cyclic population dynamics, at least when environments are not too spatially heterogeneous.",,,,,"Vasseur, David/A-2545-2013","Legault, Geoffrey/0000-0003-2136-587X; Vasseur, David/0000-0003-1706-9613",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,NOV 11,2013,8,11,,,,,,,e79527,10.1371/journal.pone.0079527,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0079527,,,,,,,,24244520,,,,,WOS:000327221600132,View Full Record in Web of Science

Synchronous fluctuations of the abundance of several populations at a regional scale can be a sign of a climatic effect on their dynamics (Moran effect). However, the interpretation of spatial synchrony is often complicated by the interaction between climatic disturbances and migrations between the studied populations. 2. We addressed this question by studying 24-year time-series of abundance estimates for four populations of four fish species in three different catchment basins in Cote d'Ivoire (West Africa). As localities from two different basins cannot exchange individuals, dispersal cannot be considered a synchronizing factor in this system. 3. A sign test performed on the four site x site correlation matrices rejected the null hypothesis of no spatial synchrony. No relation was detected in relating the level of synchrony in species dynamics (r = 0.58 on average) to the geographical distances between the four sites (176-367 km). A more detailed analysis taking account of sampling error was carried out between two sites, and confirmed the above results. When corrected for sampling noise, high values of spatial synchrony were obtained (r = 0.88 on average). 4. Interspecific spatial synchronies (r = 0.57 on average) were almost as high as intraspecific values, suggesting that the four species are reacting in the same way to the same Moran effect. 5. A good correlation (r = 0.54) between a regional river discharge index and the total catch of the four species 1 year later was observed, suggesting that hydrological variability is one of the main synchronizing factors. Moreover, as expected on theoretical grounds, spatial synchrony in river discharge (r = 0.84 and 0.88 on a log scale) is similar to spatial synchrony in population dynamics (r = 0.88 on average and corrected for sampling error).",,,,,"Tedesco, Pablo/F-7088-2013","Tedesco, Pablo/0000-0001-5972-5928",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JUL,2004,73,4,,,,,693,705,,10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00843.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00843.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000222051300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the existing studies it is shown that dispersion among identical patches results in spatial synchrony; on the other hand, the combination of spatial heterogeneity and dispersion is necessary for dispersal-induced stability (or temporal stability). Population synchrony and temporal stability are thus often thought of as conflicting outcomes of dispersion. In contrast to the general belief, in this present study we show that mean-field dispersion is conducive to both spatial synchrony and dispersal-induced stability even in identical patches. This simultaneous occurrence of rather conflicting phenomena is governed by the suppression of oscillation states, namely amplitude death (AD) and oscillation death (OD). These states emerge through spatial synchrony of the oscillating patches in the strong-coupling strength. We present an interpretation of the mean-field diffusive coupling in the context of ecology and identify that, with increasing mean-field density, an open ecosystem transforms into a closed ecosystem. We report on the occurrence of OD in an ecological model and explain its significance. Using a detailed bifurcation analysis we show that, depending on the mortality rate and carrying capacity, the system shows either AD or both AD and OD. We also show that the results remain qualitatively the same for a network of oscillators. We identify a new transition scenario between the same type of oscillation suppression states whose geneses differ. In the parameter-mismatched case, we further report on the direct transition from OD to AD through a transcritical bifurcation. We believe that this study will lead to a proper interpretation of AD and OD in ecology, which may be important for the conservation and management of several communities in ecosystems.",,,,,"Banerjee, Tanmoy/I-4281-2019; gupta, anubhav/A-9225-2019","gupta, anubhav/0000-0001-7977-9747; Dutta, Partha Sharathi/0000-0001-6067-1023; Banerjee, Tanmoy/0000-0002-6633-3233",,,,,,,,,,,,,1539-3755,1550-2376,,,,MAY 29,2015,91,5,,,,,,,52919,10.1103/PhysRevE.91.052919,http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.91.052919,,,,,,,,26066241,,,,,WOS:000355316100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results indicated that intraspecific synchrony in seed production always exceeded interspecific synchrony and was essentially constant over distances ranging from 100 m to 10 km. Asynchrony between species was at least partially attributable to differences in the endogenous dynamics in seed production caused by the varying numbers of years (1 or 2) required to mature seeds. Similarly, the magnitude of intraspecific seed production synchrony was related to intraspecific variation in endogenous dynamics; this intraspecific variation could be caused by spatial variation in habitat conditions.

Early studies emphasized identification of key mortality agents or density-dependent sources of mortality. However, these efforts became burdened by rhetorical ambiguity, and population ecologists are increasingly focusing on characterizing population behavior and identifying the processes that generate that behavior. Two types of behavior seem to be common in forest insect populations: periodic oscillations (population cycles) and spatial synchrony (synchronous fluctuations over large geographic areas). Several population processes (e.g.. host-pathogen interactions) have been demonstrated to be capable of producing periodic oscillations, but the precise identity of these processes remains uncertain for most forest insects and presents a challenge to future research. As part of these efforts, a greater emphasis is needed on the use of statistical methods for detecting periodic behavior and for identifying other types of population behavior (e.g., equilibrium dynamics, limit cycles, transient dynamics). Spatial synchrony appears to be even more ubiquitous in forest insect populations. Dispersal and regional stochasticity (Moran effect) have been shown to be capable of producing synchrony, but again more research is needed to determine the relative contribution of these processes to synchrony observed in natural populations. In addition, there is a need to search for other types of time-space patterns (e.g., traveling waves, spiral waves) in forest insect populations and to determine their causes.",,,,,"Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-3896,1438-390X,,,,DEC,2000,42,3,,,,,205,209,,10.1007/PL00011999,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00011999,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000166144800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we show that harvesting reduces the population synchrony scale if it depends more strongly on population fluctuations than the density dependence of the growth rate in the absence of harvesting. We show that constant and proportional harvesting always increases the spatial scale, using a theta-logistic model for density regulation. We also provide exact scaling results under harvesting for the Beverton-Holt and the Ricker stock-recruitment models that are commonly applied, e.g. in fisheries. Our results indicate that harvest in areas with large abundances should be encouraged to avoid increase of the spatial scale of synchrony in the population fluctuations that can lead to unexpected quasi-extinction of populations over large areas. Our results quantify this harvesting impact giving the resulting scales of spatial synchrony of population fluctuations. This emphasizes the importance of estimating the form of density dependence as well as the dependency of harvest upon population density of exploited populations, in order to get reliable predictions of the size of areas that can undergo simultaneous quasi-extinction.

We estimated spatial synchrony for total biomass, community density, densities of genera, and phytoplankton classes in a reservoir. We tested the hypotheses that synchrony levels would be high because all sites were sampled in a single waterbody; the Moran effect would be the main synchronizing mechanism; and synchrony should increase with environmental specialization of taxa. We also conducted an exploratory analysis to identify the regions of the reservoir contributing most to synchrony. We found low levels of synchrony, indicating that local factors were more important in controlling the dynamics of the local phytoplankton populations. Environmental synchrony and geographic distance were not significantly correlated with the synchrony matrices derived from genera data; however, synchrony matrices of the most abundant phytoplankton classes were mainly correlated with environmental synchrony.

While it is known that both dispersal and spatially autocorrelated environmental variation (i.e., the Moran effect) can synchronize populations, the relative contributions of each, and how they interact, are generally unknown. Distinguishing these mechanisms and their effects on synchrony can help us to better understand spatial population dynamics, design conservation and management strategies, and predict climate change impacts. Population genetic data can be used to tease apart these two processes as the spatio-temporal genetic patterns they create are expected to be different. A challenge, however, is that genetic data are often collected at a single point in time, which may introduce context-specific bias. Spatio-temporal sampling strategies can be used to reduce bias and to improve our characterization of the drivers of spatial synchrony. Using spatio-temporal analyses of genotypic data, our objective was to identify the relative support for these two mechanisms to the spatial synchrony in population dynamics of the irruptive forest insect pest, the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), in Quebec (Canada). AMOVA, cluster analysis, isolation by distance, and sPCA were used to characterize spatio-temporal genomic variation using 1,370 SBW larvae sampled over four years (2012-2015) and genotyped at 3,562 SNP loci. We found evidence of overall weak spatial genetic structure that decreased from 2012 to 2015 and a genetic diversity homogenization among the sites. We also found genetic evidence of a long-distance dispersal event over >140 km. These results indicate that dispersal is the key mechanism involved in driving population synchrony of the outbreak. Early intervention management strategies that aim to control source populations have the potential to be effective through limiting dispersal. However, the timing of such interventions relative to outbreak progression is likely to influence their probability of success.",,,,,"Johns, Robert/G-7326-2011; Levesque, Roger/ABD-8407-2021; Legault, Simon/AAF-1854-2021; Cusson, Michel/AAG-9036-2019; Larroque, Jeremy/J-2136-2019; Renaut, Sebastien/P-6236-2019","Lumley, Lisa/0000-0002-8925-8803; larroque, Jeremy/0000-0002-4371-6426; Levesque, Roger/0000-0001-8315-5937",,,,,,,,,,,,,1752-4571,,,,,DEC,2019,12,10,,,,,1931,1945,,10.1111/eva.12852,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.12852,,AUG 2019,,,,,,31700536,,,,,WOS:000483198200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Except in special circumstances(3,9), researchers historically had difficulty identifying drivers of synchrony in field systems(5,6,10). Perhaps for this reason, the possibility(9,11,12) that changes in large-scale climatic drivers may modify synchrony, thereby impacting ecosystems and human concerns, has been little examined. Here, we use wavelets to determine environmental drivers of phenological synchrony across Britain for 20 aphid species, most major crop pests. Consistently across species, changes in drivers produced large changes in aphid synchrony. Different drivers acted on different timescales: using a new wavelet analogue of the Moran theorem(1), we show that on long timescales (>4 years), 80% of synchrony in aphid first flights is due to synchrony in winter climate; but this explanation accounts for less short-timescale (<= 4 years) synchrony. Changes in aphid synchrony over time also differed by timescale: long-timescale synchrony fell from before 1993 to after, caused by similar changes in winter climate; whereas short-timescale synchrony increased. Shifts in winter climate are attributable to the North Atlantic Oscillation, an important climatic phenomenon(7,11,13), so effects described here may influence other taxa.

Yet, it remains difficult to quantify its importance relative to other factors. This is particularly true in cyclic populations in which demography, drift and dispersal contribute to spatio-temporal variability in genetic structure. Improved understanding of how dispersal influences spatial genetic structure is needed to disentangle the multiple processes that give rise to spatial synchrony in irruptive species. In this study, we examined spatial genetic structure in an economically important irruptive forest insect, the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) to better characterize how dispersal, demography and ecological context interact to influence spatial synchrony in a localized outbreak. We characterized spatial variation in microsatellite allele frequencies using 231 individuals and seven geographic locations. We show that (i) gene flow among populations is likely very high (F-st approximate to 0); (ii) despite an overall low level of genetic structure, important differences exist between adult (moth) and juvenile (larvae) life stages; and (iii) the localized outbreak is the likely source of moths captured elsewhere in our study area. This study demonstrates the potential of using molecular methods to distinguish residents from migrants and for understanding how dispersal contributes to spatial synchronization. In irruptive populations, the strength of genetic structure depends on the timing of data collection (e.g. trough vs. peak), location and dispersal.

In contrast, on the small, local scale, differences were more pronounced from year to year than from tree to tree, and were to some extent correlated with differences in acorn production, suggesting an interaction with the reproductive effort of hosts. Significant spatial synchrony was detected, particularly at the statewide scale, but in no case did synchrony decline significantly with distance, despite sites being up to 741 km apart.

Distinguishing between these mechanisms is challenging for natural populations, and the study of dispersal-induced synchrony in particular has been dominated by theoretical modelling and laboratory experiments. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the evidence for dispersal as a cause of meso-scale (distances of tens of kilometres) spatial synchrony in natural populations of the two cyclic geometrid moths Epirrita autumnata and Operophtera brumata in sub-arctic mountain birch forest in northern Norway. To infer the role of dispersal in geometrid synchrony, we applied three complementary approaches, namely estimating the effect of design-based dispersal barriers (open sea) on synchrony, comparing the strength of synchrony between E. autumnata (winged adults) and the less dispersive O. brumata (wingless adult females), and relating the directionality (anisotropy) of synchrony to the predominant wind directions during spring, when geometrid larvae engage in windborne dispersal (ballooning). The estimated effect of dispersal barriers on synchrony was almost three times stronger for the less dispersive O. brumata than E. autumnata. Inter-site synchrony was also weakest for O. brumata at all spatial lags. Both observations argue for adult dispersal as an important synchronizing mechanism at the spatial scales considered. Further, synchrony in both moth species showed distinct anisotropy and was most spatially extensive parallel to the east-west axis, coinciding closely to the overall dominant wind direction. This argues for a synchronizing effect of windborne larval dispersal. Congruent with most extensive dispersal along the east-west axis, E. autumnata also showed evidence for a travelling wave moving southwards at a speed of 50-80 km/year.

By modeling the separate effects of density regulation, environmental stochasticity, and demographic stochasticity, we estimate the spatial scaling of the component that is due to environmental stochasticity in the population dynamics of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in Norway. The estimated spatial scaling of the environmental noise was similar to 200 km. An examination of how different weather variables influenced the scaling indicated that snow depth was the major weather variable affecting the scaling of synchrony in population fluctuations, and was negatively related to population growth rates in 97.4% of the 151 populations included in the study. A large-scale climatic phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation, was positively related to population growth rates in 94.7% of the populations but did not significantly affect the pattern of synchrony among populations. We used newly developed theoretical results of the contribution of environmental noise and dispersal to the spatial scale of synchrony to show that the spatial scaling estimated in this study could not be explained by dispersal.

The range-wide declines in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations may be the result of broad-scale changes in the marine environment. Salmon undergo rapid growth in the ocean; therefore changing marine conditions may affect body size and fecundity estimates used to evaluate whether stock reference points are met. Using a dataset that spanned five decades, 172,268 individuals, and 19 rivers throughout Eastern Canada, we investigated the occurrence of spatial synchrony in changes in the body size of returning wild adult Atlantic salmon. Body size was then related to conditions in the marine environment (i.e., climate indices, thermal habitat availability, food availability, density-dependence, and fisheries exploitation rates) that may act on all populations during the ocean feeding phase of their life cycle. Body size increased during the 1980s and 1990s for salmon that returned to rivers after one (1SW) or two winters at sea (2SW); however, significant changes were only observed for 1SW and/or 2SW in some mid-latitude and northern rivers (10/13 rivers with 10 of more years of data during these decades) and not in southern rivers (0/2), suggesting weak spatial synchrony across Eastern Canada. For 1SW salmon in nine rivers, body size was longer when fisheries exploitation rates were lower. For 2SW salmon, body size was longer when suitable thermal habitat was more abundant (significant for 3/8 rivers) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation was higher (i.e., warmer sea surface temperatures; significant for 4/8 rivers). Overall, the weak spatial synchrony and variable effects of covariates on body size across rivers suggest that changes in Atlantic salmon body size may not be solely driven by shared conditions in the marine environment. Regardless, body size changes may have consequences for population management and recovery through the relationship between size and fecundity.",,,,,"Imlay, Tara/J-6599-2019; Robertson, Martha/B-5031-2009; Dauphin, Guillaume/E-3677-2010","Robertson, Martha J/0009-0001-8209-9985; Imlay, Tara/0000-0001-9011-3217; Dauphin, Guillaume/0000-0003-3066-6842",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,JUN,2024,14,6,,,,,,,e11538,10.1002/ece3.11538,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11538,,,,,,,,38859887,,,,,WOS:001242473400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several mechanisms have been advanced to explain this, but their importance in nature is often uncertain. Theoretical studies suggest that spatial synchrony initiated in one species through Moran effects may propagate among trophically linked species, but evidence for this in nature is lacking. By applying the nonparametric spatial correlation function to time series data, we discover that densities of the gypsy moth, the moth's chief predator (the white-footed mouse), and the mouse's winter food source (red oak acorns) fluctuate synchronously over similar distances (similar to 1000 km) and with similar levels of synchrony. In addition, we investigate the importance of consumer-resource interactions in propagating synchrony among species using an empirically informed simulation model of interactions between acorns, the white-footed mouse, the gypsy moth, and a viral pathogen of the gypsy moth. Our results reveal that regional stochasticity acting directly on populations of the mouse, moth, or pathogen likely has little effect on levels of the synchrony displayed by these species. In contrast, synchrony in mast seeding can propagate across trophic levels, thus explaining observed levels of synchrony in both white-footed mouse and gypsy moth populations.

In addition to applied research (optimisation of monitoring networks and population persistence), spatial synchrony has important implications for unravelling the processes underlying environmental and biological dynamics. We quantified the levels of synchrony among six sites in a tropical reservoir (Lajes Reservoir, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) over 85 months (from August 2001 to December 2009) for twelve environmental variables, four broad zooplankton groups (testate amoebae, rotifers, cladocerans and copepods) and 23 abundant taxa. We hypothesised that (a) environmental synchrony would be higher than biological synchrony; (b) high synchrony would be found; and (c) biological synchrony matrices would be positively correlated with environmental synchrony and negatively correlated with both environmental and geographic distances. A strong relationship between biological synchrony and environmental matrices, when compared to geographic distance, would be consistent with the hypothesis that similar environmental variability synchronises the dynamics of local populations (Moran effect). In comparison to previous studies, we found high levels of synchrony. Environmental synchrony was often higher than biological synchrony, which was in line with our expectation and previous findings. The high levels of synchrony found in this study suggest that reservoir zonation was not enough to desynchronise the dynamics at the sites for both environmental and biological variables. Spatial synchrony in zooplankton populations declined more consistently with environmental distance than with geographic distance. Additionally, environmental distances were unrelated to geographic distances. Taken together, these results indicate a preponderant role of the Moran effect. Thus, as synchrony increases extinction rates, we speculate that novel ecosystems may be highly susceptible to regional-wide changes in environmental factors.",,,,,"Lopes, Vanessa/HHN-7848-2022; Bini, Luis Mauricio/D-5865-2013","Bini, Luis Mauricio/0000-0003-3398-9399; Ferreira de Sousa-Filho, Izidro/0000-0001-9210-0399; Castelo Branco, Christina W/0000-0002-0509-171X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,DEC,2018,63,12,,,,,1592,1601,,10.1111/fwb.13188,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13188,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000450068500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examined spatial synchrony and concordance among population trajectories of five aerial insectivorous bird species: chimney swift Chaetura pelagica, purple martin Progne subis, barn swallow Hirundo rustica, tree swallow Tachycineta bicolor, and northern rough-winged swallow Stelgidopteryx serripennis. Aerial insectivores have undergone severe guild-wide declines that were considered more prevalent in northeastern North America. Here, we addressed four general questions including spatial synchrony within species, spatial concordance among species, frequency of declining trends among species, and geographic location of declining trends. We used dynamic factor analysis to identify large-scale common trends underlying stratum-specific annual indices for each species, representing population trajectories shared by spatially synchronous populations, from 46 yr of North American Breeding Bird Survey data. Indices were derived from Bayesian hierarchical models with continuous autoregressive spatial structures. Stratum-level spatial concordance among species was assessed using cross-correlation analysis. Probability of long-term declining trends was compared among species using Bayesian generalized linear models. Chimney swifts exhibited declining trends throughout North America, with less severe declines through the industrialized Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regions. Northern rough-winged swallows exhibited declining trends throughout the west. Spatial concordance among species was limited, the proportion of declining trends varied among species, and contrary to previous reports, declining trends were not more prevalent in the northeast. Purple martins, barn swallows, and tree swallows exhibited synchrony across smaller spatial scales. The extensive within-species synchrony and limited concordance suggest that population trajectories of these aerial insectivores are responding to large-scale but complex and species-and region-specific environmental conditions (e.g. climate, land use).

Drifts from synchrony to asynchrony and again back to synchrony across several centuries were observed. The chronologies showed higher (or lower) coefficients of correlations and correspondingly gentler (or steeper) declines in spatial synchrony in certain periods. In accordance with research into other ecological phenomena, the origin of the spatial synchrony was found to relate to the intensity of the westerly circulation over the Atlantic and Europe as described by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. The tree rings from all of the analysed subregions were found to be wider, identifying faster periods of growth, when there was a positive NAO during the extended winter season from December to March that preceded the period of growth. Previous studies showed that the NAO index can be linked with the growth of tree rings because of factors in the local climate that affect growth, such as temperature and precipitation. Moreover, the spatial synchrony showed multidecadal fluctuations that were correlated with variations of a similar scale in the reconstructed NAO index. However, a high degree of spatial synchrony was observed during the 20(th) century in the presence of values of NAO index that were strongly negative. A more detailed view was provided by maps of the correlations in which spatial changes were demonstrated in the growth of pines between the 12(th) and the 20(th) century. These results could be used as background information in the development of improved proxy-based reconstructions of the NAO index (or other similar meteorological variables), which could also be inferred from tree ring data relating to earlier centuries.

Using data from 1978-2006, we quantified the spatial synchrony in recruitment and population catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for bloater (Coregonus hoyi) populations across lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron. In this natural field experiment, climate was highly synchronous across lakes but the likelihood of dispersal between lakes differed. When data from all lakes were pooled, modified correlograms revealed spatial synchrony to occur up to 800 km for long-term (data not detrended) trends and up to 600 km for short-term (data detrended by the annual rate of change) trends. This large spatial synchrony more than doubles the scale previously observed in freshwater fish populations, and exceeds the scale found in most marine or estuarine populations. When analyzing the data separately for within- and between-lake pairs, spatial synchrony was always observed within lakes, up to 400 or 600 km. Conversely, between-lake synchrony did not occur among short-term trends, and for long-term trends, the scale of synchrony was highly variable. For recruit CPUE, synchrony occurred up to 600 km between both lakes Michigan and Huron (where dispersal was most likely) and lakes Michigan and Superior (where dispersal was least likely), but failed to occur between lakes Huron and Superior (where dispersal likelihood was intermediate). When considering the scale of putative bloater dispersal and genetic information from previous studies, we concluded that dispersal was likely underlying within-lake synchrony but climate was more likely underlying between-lake synchrony. The broad scale of synchrony in Great Lakes bloater populations increases their probability of extirpation, a timely message for fishery managers given current low levels of bloater abundance.",,,,,,"Roseman, Edward/0000-0002-5315-9838; Bunnell, David/0000-0003-3521-7747",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,MAR,2010,162,3,,,,,641,651,,10.1007/s00442-009-1487-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1487-6,,,,,,,,19888603,,,,,WOS:000274518000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

I examined the relationship between synchrony, abundance of wetlands (ponds), distance, and agricultural cover using count data of ten duck species counted in 23 aerial survey strata on the mid-continental prairies of North America. Expansion of agriculture may have resulted in increased synchrony of duck populations through increased foraging efficiency of nomadic predators and/or if the homogenization of nesting habitat has removed habitat features that allow differential local responses to large-scale population drivers such as precipitation. As a measure of synchrony, I calculated all pair-wise cross-correlation coefficients based on population growth rates (r(t)) at each survey stratum, and then regressed these correlation coefficients against measures of cross-correlation of pond (wetland) counts, distance between strata, and mean percent area of strata seeded to row crops. Synchrony for most species was most strongly related to synchrony of wetland availability among sites, and decreased with distance between sites. Synchrony of ducks that nest over water showed little effect of agricultural cover, whereas the effect of agricultural cover on synchrony of upland nesting ducks differed by species.

Because bank vole (Myodes glareolus) populations usually peak 1 year after peaks in reproduction of the staple winter food plant bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), we tested for a possible link between food and spatial synchrony by comparing the synchrony in bank vole population indices and bilberry seed production indices between three study areas across about 20,000 km(2) in South Norway during a four decade period (1979-2019). There were subperiods of spatial synchrony and asynchrony between the study areas in the fluctuations of bank vole numbers and bilberry seed production, with the latter part of the study period displaying more pronounced synchrony than the first and middle part. However, with a few marked exceptions, when vole fluctuations were spatially out of phase across study areas so was bilberry seed production. Thus, we conclude that bilberry seed production to a large extent explained the spatiotemporal synchronicity in bank vole population fluctuations. Although bilberry seed production seems to be a causal driver of vole fluctuations, it remains to be seen to what extent the chemical composition of bilberry plants influences vole performance.

The effects of climatic variation and dispersal have been invoked to explain synchronous population dynamics, however an understanding of the relative influence of these drivers in natural populations is lacking. Here we compare support for dispersal-versus climate-driven models of interspecific variation in synchrony using 27 years of observations of 65 butterfly species at 10 sites spanning 2750m of elevation in Northern California. The degree of spatial synchrony exhibited by each butterfly species was used as a response in a unique approach that allowed us to investigate whether interspecific variation in response to climate or dispersal propensity was most predictive of interspecific variation in synchrony. We report that variation in sensitivity to climate explained 50% of interspecific variation in synchrony, whereas variation in dispersal propensity explained 23%. Sensitivity to the El Nino Southern Oscillation, a primary driver of regional climate, was the best predictor of synchrony. Combining sensitivity to climate and dispersal propensity into a single model did not greatly increase model performance, confirming the primacy of climatic sensitivity for driving spatial synchrony in butterflies.

The coefficients of variation of sound seeds (1.3-2.1) were greater than those of total seeds (0.8-1.3) in each site. Pre-dispersal seed predation by moth larvae has a major influence on sound seed production in E crenata. To test whether variation in annual total seed production resulted in fluctuations in predator populations, we examined the relationship between the ratio of current year total seed production to previous year total seed production, and the percentage of pre-dispersal seed predation in the current year. We found a negative correlation between insect predation and the ratio of current to previous year total seed production, suggesting that poor total seed years resulted in a decrease in predator populations. The pre-dispersal seed predators of F crenata appeared to cope well with up to 10-fold variation in total seed production between years, but when the total seed production exceeded 20 times that of the prior year, the predators were satiated.

The degree of synchrony and spatial extent of synchrony are important considerations when assessing the population as a whole. We examined these aspects in red drum Sciaenops ocellatus along the coast of South Carolina using long-term survey data of juvenile abundance in estuarine areas separated by up to similar to 200 km. Synchrony of year class strength was detected among areas, but the degree of synchrony declined significantly with distance. By comparison, genetic segregation along the coast was either weak or undetectable (based on allele frequencies at 8 microsatellite loci), although it depended on the year class (2004, 2005 or 2007) of fish that was tested. By standardizing juvenile abundance data across estuaries and survey types, a single, region-wide juvenile time series was generated that covered the 1985-2007 year classes. The juvenile time series correlated significantly with the year class composition of the present-day adult population, which was determined using otoliths collected by a separate survey operating in deeper adult habitats.

We used multiple regression of distance matrices (MRMs) to statistically partition the importance of several factors potentially synchronizing the dynamics of the gypsy moth, an invasive species in North America, exhibiting outbreaks that are partially synchronized over long distances (approx. 900 km). The factors considered in the MRM were synchrony in weather conditions, spatial proximity and forest-type similarity. We found that the most likely driver of outbreak synchrony is synchronous precipitation. Proximity played no apparent role in influencing outbreak synchrony after accounting for precipitation, suggesting dispersal does not drive outbreak synchrony. Because a previous modelling study indicated weather might indirectly synchronize outbreaks through synchronization of oak masting and generalist predators that feed upon acorns, we also examined the influence of weather and proximity on synchrony of acorn production. As we found for outbreak synchrony, synchrony in oak masting increased with synchrony in precipitation, though it also increased with proximity. We conclude that precipitation could synchronize gypsy moth populations directly, as in a Moran effect, or indirectly, through effects on oak masting, generalist predators or diseases.",,,,,"Bjornstad, Ottar/I-4518-2012; Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008; Haynes, Kyle/C-1374-2012","Haynes, Kyle/0000-0002-3283-6633",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,FEB 22,2013,280,1753,,,,,,,20122373,10.1098/rspb.2012.2373,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.2373,,,,,,,,23282993,,,,,WOS:000313510600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

WalleyeSander vitreuspopulations often exhibit variable year-class strength, which has been attributed to a suite of factors. In this study, we quantified variability in Walleye recruitment, assessed within-lake recruitment synchrony, and modeled recruitment variability for year-classes that were produced from 1988 to 2013 in Lake Oahe, a large Missouri River reservoir. The objectives of this study were to determine (1) whether Walleye recruit annually, (2) whether Walleye recruitment is spatially synchronous, and (3) whether Walleye recruitment is better described by biotic or abiotic factors. The variability of Walleye recruitment was indexed by using gill-net catch of age-2 Walleye across nine locations in Lake Oahe, and factors affecting recruitment were evaluated by using stock-recruit analysis. Over the 26 years that were assessed, all year-classes were present and four exceptionally large year-classes were produced. Recruitment synchrony was apparent among locations within Lake Oahe, but this relationship was largely influenced by the spatial synchrony of the four exceptionally large year-classes and was no longer detectable when those year-classes were removed. The relative abundance of age-4 and older Walleye, taken as an index of spawner abundance, was a poor predictor of Walleye recruitment, indicating that Walleye recruitment was regulated by density-independent factors across the range of observations. The interactive effects of reservoir elevation and elevation change improved model fit to explain 59% of the recruitment variation and indicated that increased elevation from the previous year improved recruitment. Our results indicate that Walleye recruitment may be favored by increasing the water levels in the reservoir in spring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0275-5947,1548-8675,,,,OCT,2020,40,5,,,,,1133,1145,,10.1002/nafm.10477,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10477,,SEP 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000565314100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Large-scale spatial synchrony is common in population dynamics. In nearly all empirical data sets, population synchrony decays with distance. 2. Large-scale spatial population synchrony of 20 common moth species was studied using 367 separate light-trap time series of 3-27 years, at 13-19 localities in southern Finland. The maximum distance between trap sites was ca 1075 km. The degree of spatial synchrony in three weather variables (daily mean and minimum temperature, and daily total precipitation) from 15 weather stations was also studied. Data were analysed with spatial non-parametric correlation functions (Sncf). 3. Statistically significant large-scale spatial synchrony in population fluctuations occurred in 85% of the species (Scotopteryx chenopodiata, Eulithis populata, Chloroclysta citrata, Epirrita autumnata, Perizoma alchemillata, P. didymata, Eupithecia pusillata, Macaria wauaria, Itame brunneata, Cabera pusaria, C. exanthemata, Eilema lurideola, Rusina ferruginea, Amphipoea fucosa, Orthosia gothica, Cerapteryx graminis and Diarsia mendica), as well as in all weather variables. 4.

At the local level, the main drivers of spatial synchrony were water availability and flowering phenology of individual trees, while proximity, temperature differences between trees, and genetic similarity failed to explain a significant proportion of variance in spatial synchrony. At the statewide level, annual rainfall was the primary driver, while proximity was significant by itself but not when controlling for rainfall; genetic similarity was again not significant. These results support the hypothesis that environmental factors, the Moran effect, are key drivers of spatial synchrony in acorn production at both small and large geographic scales. The specific environmental factors differed depending on the geographic scale, but were in both cases related to water availability.

The combination of time-scale separation between interacting species and weak spatial linear diffusive coupling is one mechanism that can generate synchrony; however, accounting for travel time between habitat patches may destabilize this synchrony. Here, we show that ubiquitous behavioral aspects of dispersal (e. g., predator avoidance), implemented as nonlinear diffusive coupling, may also destabilize synchrony. In addition, these aspects interact with travel-time delays and amplify mechanisms that destroy synchrony. Our work suggests that dispersal-induced synchrony is more rare than typically assumed.

Estimation of the spatial autocorrelation of grouse population dynamics across moors indicates relatively high levels of synchrony between populations on adjacent moors, but that this synchrony declines sharply with increasing inter-moor distance. At distances of greater than 100 km, grouse population time-series exhibit only weakly positive cross-correlation coefficients. Twenty-eight geographical, environmental and other candidate variables were examined to construct a general linear model to explain variation in local synchrony. Grouse moor productivity (average size of shooting bag), distance from the Atlantic coast moving in a north-easterly direction, April and June temperatures, and June rainfall significantly increased the explanatory power of this model.

The long-term viability of metapopulations is dependent on independent dynamics of local populations, because it mitigates fluctuations in the size of the metapopulation as a whole. Metapopulation viability will be compromised if climate change increases spatial synchrony in weather conditions associated with population growth rates. We studied a recently reported increase in metapopulation synchrony of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in the Finnish archipelago, to see if it could be explained by an increase in synchrony of weather conditions. For this, we used 23years of butterfly survey data together with monthly weather records for the same period. We first examined the associations between population growth rates within different regions of the metapopulation and weather conditions during different life-history stages of the butterfly. We then examined the association between the trends in the synchrony of the weather conditions and the synchrony of the butterfly metapopulation dynamics. We found that precipitation from spring to late summer are associated with the M. cinxia per capita growth rate, with early summer conditions being most important. We further found that the increase in metapopulation synchrony is paralleled by an increase in the synchrony of weather conditions. Alternative explanations for spatial synchrony, such as increased dispersal or trophic interactions with a specialist parasitoid, did not show paralleled trends and are not supported. The climate driven increase in M. cinxia metapopulation synchrony suggests that climate change can increase extinction risk of spatially structured populations living in fragmented landscapes by altering their dynamics.",,,,,"; Saastamoinen, Marjo/F-6576-2012; van Nouhuys, Saskya/C-6813-2013","Kahilainen, Aapo/0000-0001-9180-6998; Schulz, Torsti/0000-0001-8940-9483; Saastamoinen, Marjo/0000-0001-7009-2527; van Nouhuys, Saskya/0000-0003-2206-1368",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,SEP,2018,24,9,,,,,4316,4329,,10.1111/gcb.14280,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14280,,,,,,,,29682866,,,,,WOS:000441746900035,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temporal fluctuations of these environmental drivers are often synchronized at large spatial scales. Yet, whether synchronous environmental conditions can generate spatial synchrony in fitness-related trait values (i.e., correlated temporal trait fluctuations across populations) is poorly understood. Using data from long-term monitored populations of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus, n = 31), great tits (Parus major, n = 35), and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca, n = 20) across Europe, we assessed the influence of two local climatic variables (mean temperature and mean precipitation in February-May) on spatial synchrony in three fitness-related traits: laying date, clutch size, and fledgling number. We found a high degree of spatial synchrony in laying date but a lower degree in clutch size and fledgling number for each species. Temperature strongly influenced spatial synchrony in laying date for resident blue tits and great tits but not for migratory pied flycatchers. This is a relevant finding in the context of environmental impacts on populations because spatial synchrony in fitness-related trait values among populations may influence fluctuations in vital rates or population abundances. If environmentally induced spatial synchrony in fitness-related traits increases the spatial synchrony in vital rates or population abundances, this will ultimately increase the risk of extinction for populations and species.

How do such species manage to persist? One possibility is metapopulation dynamics, but it is unclear if these can mitigate the paradox of enrichment. The paradox of enrichment might increase local population extinction rates, and might also increase the spatial synchrony of population fluctuations because population cycles are easily synchronized by even low rates of dispersal. Spatially-synchronous population fluctuations would leave no scope for rescue effects, and spatially-synchronous local extinctions would leave no source for recolonization. We conducted a protist microcosm experiment to test how dispersal and enrichment affect the persistence of predator-prey metapopulations by altering spatial synchrony. We assembled 54, 4-patch metapopulations of the protist predator Euplotes patella and its protist prey Tetrahymena pyriformis. Each metapopulation experienced one of nine dispersal rates, crossed with one of six enrichment levels. We tested the effects of enrichment and dispersal on predator-prey cycle amplitude, predator population extinction risk, spatial synchrony of predator population fluctuations, and predator metapopulation persistence time. Enrichment increased predator-prey cycle amplitude but had no detectable effect on population extinction risk. Dispersal had no effect on predator-prey cycle amplitude. Spatial synchrony increased with enrichment and dispersal. Metapopulation persistence decreased with enrichment and spatial synchrony. We conclude that increasing enrichment reduced metapopulation persistence primarily by increasing spatial synchrony of local extinctions, rather than by increasing their frequency. These results highlight the importance of synchrony-preventing mechanisms for metapopulation persistence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,JAN,2020,129,1,,,,,49,58,,10.1111/oik.06552,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.06552,,SEP 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000486270000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

(1999) on how spatial autocorrelated noise, dispersal rate and distance as well as strength of density regulation determine the spatial scale of synchrony in population density. It is shown how demographic noise can be incorporated, what effect it has on variance and spatial scale of synchrony, and how it interacts with the point process for locations of individuals under random sampling. Although the effect of demographic noise is a rather complex interaction with environmental noise, migration and density regulation, its effect on population fluctuations and scale of synchrony can be presented in a transparent way. This is achieved by defining a characteristic area dependent on demographic and environmental variances as well as population density, and subsequently using this area to define a spatial demographic coefficient. The demographic noise acts through this coefficient on the spatial synchrony, which may increase or decrease with increasing demographic noise depending on other parameters. A second generalization yields the modeling of density regulation taking into account that regulation at a given location does not only depend on the density at that site but also on densities in the whole territory or home range of individuals. It is shown that such density regulation with a spatial scale reduces the scale of synchrony in population fluctuations relative to the simpler model with density regulation at each location determined only by the local point density, and may even generate negative spatial autocorrelations.

Yet, previous studies have been strongly biased geographically toward high latitude (boreal ecosystem) and limited in their spatial scale, i.e., few sampling sites separated by a few tens of kilometers. Both aspects currently limit our understanding of rodent population dynamics across space. In this study we investigate vole population synchrony at a large spatial scale in central Europe.We used long-termbreeding success of a vole-eating raptor specialist, the European kestrel, as an indicator of vole abundance. We first demonstrate that the productivity of kestrels is highly dependent on the availability of voles and as such is a good proxy of vole abundance. Secondly, we assessed the spatial synchrony of kestrel productivity and its scaling.We found that kestrel productivity fluctuated synchronously at a large spatial scale, up to a distance of 300 km. This result suggests that vole populations in central Europe varied in synchrony at large spatial scales, similarly as in northern latitudes. The most likely mechanism resulting in such large scale synchrony of vole populations is synchronized density-independent environmental conditions.",,,,,,"Schaub, Michael/0000-0003-2745-0557",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,JAN 21,2020,7,,,,,,,,512,10.3389/fevo.2019.00512,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00512,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000593919400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Spatial networks of tree growth have been widely discussed from regional to global scales, but few studies have reported stable oxygen isotopes in networks of tree rings (delta O-18(tree)), thus impeding a comprehensive hydroclimatic interpretation of delta O-18(tree) records over large spatial scales, i.e., isoscapes. In this study, a network of four annually resolved delta O-18(tree) chronologies (1805-2016) was developed for Southwest China, the transitional zone of the Asian summer monsoon, to test spatial coherence in delta O-18(tree) variations and to explore the climatic factors driving synchrony at different spatial scales. The quantitative analyses show that the four chronologies exhibit consistent annual variations, with the first principal component (PC1) accounting for 70% of the total variance, which uniformly respond to local relative humidity (RH) and precipitation delta O-18 during the monsoon season. This confirms the spatial coherence in delta O-18(tree) records. Furthermore, significant inter-site correlations of local RH and precipitation delta O-18 are also detected, revealing that it is the regionally homogeneous year-to-year variations in the hydroclimate that should be responsible for spatial coherence. For a larger spatial perspective, spatial correlation analyses reveal that the most prominent correlations between delta O-18(tree) and hydroclimate fields occur in the Indochina Peninsula, in which delta O-18(tree) changes are synchronized with those in Southwest China and the synchrony temporally varies with the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) intensity, indicating that coherent delta O-18(tree) variations are linked to ISM-related moisture transport. In addition, delta O-18(tree) records have shown strong in-phase relationships with the natural variabilities of the ISM and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) across interannual and interdecadal timescales over the last 150 years, suggesting that spatial coherence in delta O-18(tree) records can be utilized to reflect the long-term history of large-scale atmospheric circulation.",,,,,"Sano, Masaki/HNI-0746-2023; Fan, Haowen/GPT-4634-2022; Su, Jiajia/HGA-4440-2022","Sano, Masaki/0000-0003-3391-9067; Fan, Haowen/0000-0002-1648-560X; Su, Jiajia/0000-0001-7280-8859",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-1923,1873-2240,,,,DEC 15,2021,311,,,,,,,,108687,10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108687,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108687,,OCT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000710990900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are numerous ways of inferring spatial structures, and information from multiple methods is becoming more common to examine how different processes shape the spatial structures of species to improve fish management. Here, we investigate the spatial structure of a suite of Baltic Sea fish species based on the following: (i) spatial (presumably neutral) genetic differentiation, reviewed from the literature, and (ii) spatial synchrony in abundance changes from time series of fishery-independent surveys, which we currently find to be under-used given the amount of data available. For each of these two methods, species were classified as having a distinct, continuous or no/weak spatial structure. In addition, based on each source of information, we estimated the spatial scale of management units for species. The results show that only among species confined to the coastal zone the two sources of information yielded a congruence of the spatial structure (displaying a continuous spatial structure). In contrast, offshore species show weak spatial genetic structure but stronger spatial structure of synchrony in abundance. Based on this, we suggest that population genetic structure and synchrony in abundance should be used as complementary information as they reflect different spatial processes and suggest that management actions should differ with respect to scale depending on the management targets applied. We propose similar analysis should be applied to areas outside the Baltic Sea, and other stock identification methods, to improve management of fish resources.",,,,,"Östman, Örjan/ABF-8714-2020","Palm, Stefan/0000-0002-9890-8265; Ostman, Orjan/0000-0002-1930-0148",,,,,,,,,,,,,1467-2960,1467-2979,,,,MAR,2017,18,2,,,,,324,339,,10.1111/faf.12182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.12182,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000397295600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Spatial synchrony in turn may jeopardize metapopulation persistence. Joining results from previous studies suggests that spatial synchrony is highest at moderate over-compensation and is low at compensating and at very strong over-compensating density regulation. We scrutinize this supposition of a unimodal relationship using a process-based metapopulation model with explicit local population dynamics. We extend the usually studied range of density regulation to under-compensation and analyse resulting metapopulation persistence. We find peaks of spatial synchrony not only at over-compensatory but also under-compensatory density regulation and show that effects of local density compensation on synchrony follow a bimodal rather than unimodal relationship. Persistence of metapopulations however, shows a unimodal relationship with a broad plateau of high persistence from compensatory to over-compensatory density regulation. This range of high persistence comprises both levels of low and high spatial synchrony. Thus, not synchrony alone jeopardizes metapopulation persistence, but only in interplay with high local extinction risk. The functional forms of the relations of density compensation with spatial synchrony and persistence are robust to increases in dispersal mortality, landscape dynamics, or density dependence of dispersal. However, with each of these increases the maxima of spatial synchrony and persistence shift to higher overcompensation and levels of synchrony are reduced. Overall, for over-compensation high landscape connectivity has negative effects while for under-compensation connectivity affects persistence positively. This emphasizes the importance of species life-history traits for management decisions with regard to landscape connectivity: while dispersal corridors are essential for species with under-compensatory density regulation, they may have detrimental effects for endangered species with over-compensation.

Data from Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (EMS) transect counts were used to investigate the decline in synchrony of population fluctuations with increasing distance between sample units, and to evaluate the relative effects of local and regional scale processes on population fluctuations. 2. Each BMS transect is divided into sections and numbers (densities) of butterflies are recorded separately in each section. Local scale analyses examined population fluctuations on different sections within a single transect. Regional scale analyses examined fluctuations on different transects. 3. At the local scale population dynamics were found to be more closely synchronized between very close population units (sections) than more distant ones. There was considerable variation between data sets but on average this correlation declined relatively quickly over 1-2 km. 4. At the regional scale, where local environmental heterogeneity was averaged out (sections were lumped together within transect sites), the decline in synchrony with increasing distance (up to 200 km) was very small compared with local scale decrease, and populations remain partially synchronized throughout the range studied due to regionally correlated weather patterns. 5. Butterfly dispersal had a significant effect on synchrony at a local scale (several km): the dynamics of populations of relatively mobile species remained correlated over relatively long distances. At the regional level, however, mobility was not a significant factor, implying that widespread environmental stochasticity is of over-riding importance at this scale. 6. Although mobility and distance are significant factors in determining population synchrony/asynchrony, the low r(2) values attributable to them indicate that these factors are actually contributing relatively little to the overall dynamics. Butterfly species show local variation in population dynamics, nested within broad scale synchrony which is presumably generated by the climate. Heterogeneity in population dynamics, in local environments, potentially aids metapopulation persistence by buffering the effects of high levels of temporal environmental stochasticity.",,,,,"Thomas, Chris/A-1894-2012","Thomas, Chris/0000-0003-2822-1334",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,,,,,JAN,1996,65,1,,,,,85,95,,10.2307/5702,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/5702,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996TR13000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Significant synchrony in the timing of epidemics exists across the entire state and decay with distance (regional correlation = 62%). Synchrony as a function of population size display evidence of hierarchical spread with more synchronized epidemics occurring among the most populated counties. A gravity model describing movement between two populations is a stronger predictor of influenza spread than adult movement to and from workplaces suggesting that non-routine and leisure travel drive local epidemics.

Masting in beech shows distance-decay, but significant synchrony is maintained at spatial scales of up to 1,500 km. The spatial synchrony of the weather cues that drive interannual variation in reproduction also explains the regional spatial synchrony of masting. Proximity played no apparent role in influencing beech masting synchrony after controlling for synchrony in environmental variation. Synchrony of beech reproduction shows a clear biogeographical pattern, decreasing from the northwest to southeast Europe. Synchrony networks for weather cues resemble networks for beech masting, indicating that the geographical structure of weather synchrony underlies the biogeography of masting synchrony.

On the other hand, demographic responses to heterogeneous, local environments may result in substantial local population variability (i.e., variance across multiple populations). This study used the Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal dynamic model to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of 27 eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) populations scattered across Mississippi, USA, from 1994 to 2005. The regional effects of seasonal climate and relative amount of forest in habitats were also evaluated to test the Moran effect. Twenty seven wild turkey populations had a spatial synchrony with the strength and spatial scale similar to those of other avian populations in North America. Warming spring or spring-autumn climate appeared to reduce wild turkey relative abundance; however, winter climate did not influence the dynamics of wild turkey populations in Mississippi. Average proportion of forest affected the average relative abundance of wild turkeys in a nonlinear manner, with its positive effects switching to a lessened constant effect beyond the threshold of 60% forest cover. However, regional climatic variability was unlikely to synchronize wild turkey populations in Mississippi.

Fish capture was conducted at nine sites, including rivers or agricultural ditches independently flowing into the lake, every September from 2005 to 2013. Large fluctuations in the abundance of four bitterling species were observed during survey years. Regional population decline of Acheilognathus tabira erythropterus and Acheilognathus melanogaster was detected through 9 years of survey. In addition, spatial synchrony between bitterling species was also observed in the population dynamics. On the other hand, no significant synchrony was observed between bitterlings and the two non-bitterling species. Synchrony of native bitterlings declined with increasing distance, whereas that of Rhodeus ocellatus ocellatus was almost constant regardless of distance. These results supported that the spatially synchronous decline of bitterling species was caused by the Moran effect and dispersal. In other words, results of this study showed that factors that vary over a regional scale, such as climate, and the loss of connectivity among habitats may have contributed to the decline of bitterling species.",,,,,"Morosawa, Takahiro/JXX-1571-2024","Morosawa, Takahiro/0000-0003-3908-1787",,,,,,,,,,,,,1341-8998,1616-3915,,,,JUL,2023,70,3,,,,,368,377,,10.1007/s10228-022-00898-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-022-00898-7,,DEC 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000900985600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We report patterns of temporal Variation in the recruitment of roach (Rutilus rutilus). The data consist of the annual abundance of the first 2 year-classes, 0 + and 1+ fish, at four sites in the Rhone River (France) between 1987 and 1997. Over this 11-year period both Of and It fish fluctuated strongly. 2. Cross-correlation indicated high spatial synchrony in 0+ dynamics, although correlations among sites in 1+ dynamics were weaker. No clear pattern was apparent in the relationship between the level of synchrony and distance between pairs of sites. 3. The spatial synchrony in 0 + fish could be attributable to large-scale variations in weather, influencing water temperature. Total body length of 0 + roach was correlated with water temperature (expressed in degree-days over 12 degreesC), and water temperature was the main factor explaining inter-annual variation in 0+ cohort size. Monthly variation in abiotic factors (measured by standard deviation in water temperature and discharge) did not influence 0+ fluctuations. Correlations with June water temperature suggest that year-class strength was mainly determined by abiotic factors during the first few months of life. 4. The absence of spatial synchrony in 1+ fluctuations suggests little correlation between survival and abiotic conditions during the first year of life, other factors influencing survival. 5. Survival in the first year was density-dependent. Intraspecific competition within the 0+ cohort could thus influence the fluctuations in recruitment to older age-classes. 6. The implications of age- or stage-dependent synchrony in temporal variation for species with complex life histories are discussed.

Here, we analyse spatio-temporal dynamics of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in a network of 4000 dry meadows during 21 years. The results demonstrate two strong, related patterns: the amplitude of year-to-year fluctuations in the size of the metapopulation as a whole has increased, though there is no long-term trend in average abundance; and there is a highly significant increase in the level of spatial synchrony in population dynamics. The increased synchrony cannot be explained by increasing within-year spatial correlation in precipitation, the key environmental driver of population change, or in per capita growth rate. On the other hand, the frequency of drought during a critical life-history stage (early larval instars) has increased over the years, which is sufficient to explain the increasing amplitude and the expanding spatial synchrony in metapopulation dynamics. Increased spatial synchrony has the general effect of reducing long-term metapopulation viability even if there is no change in average metapopulation size. This study demonstrates how temporal changes in weather conditions can lead to striking changes in spatio-temporal population dynamics.",,,,,"Tack, Ayco/B-7120-2017","Tack, Ayco/0000-0002-3550-1070; Mononen, Tommi/0000-0002-3603-0813",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,MAY 7,2015,282,1806,,,,,,,20150173,10.1098/rspb.2015.0173,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.0173,,,,,,,,25854888,,,,,WOS:000353351000020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The following hypothesis were tested: (i) the populations of a given species present the same fluctuation pattern in abundance for different environments and (ii) synchrony is higher when we consider subsets of neighboring environments or those belonging to the same category (e.g., lagoons, rivers). Samplings were performed every three months from February 2000 to November 2002 at I I sites. To evaluate spatial synchrony, the intraclass correlation coefficient was used. The results showed no significant cot-relation for the most abundant species, meaning that fluctuation patterns of planktonic cladocerans were asynchronous. Asynchrony indicated that the influence of floods and regional climatic factors was not strong enough to synchronize the populations, suggesting that local factors were more important than regional effects in determining zooplankton abundance patterns. The implications of these results are that the observations from a single environment cannot be extrapolated to other environments in a manner that would allow its use as a sentinel site.

Spatially correlated environmental noises, dispersal, and trophic interactions have been considered as the causes of spatial synchrony. In this study, we develop a spatially structured population model, which is described by coupled-map lattices and incorporates both dispersal and colored environmental noise. A method for generating time series with desired spatial correlation and color is introduced. Then, we use these generated time series to analyze the influence of noise color on synchrony in population dynamics. The noise color refers to the temporal correlation in the time series data of the noise, and is expressed as the degree of (first-order) autocorrelation for autoregressive noise. Patterns of spatial synchrony are considered for stable, periodic and chaotic population dynamics. Numerical simulations verify that environmental noise color has a major influence on the level of synchrony. which depends strongly on how noise is introduced into the model. Furthermore, the influence of noise color also depends on patterns of dispersal between local populations. In addition, the clesynchronizing effect of reddened noise is always weaker than that of white noise. From our results, we notice that the role of reddened environmental noise on spatial synchrony should be treated carefully and cautiously, especially for the spatially structured populations linked by dispersal.

We investigated how two dispersal behaviours, namely prey evasion (PE) and predator pursuit (PP), affect the dynamics of a predator-prey system. PE portrays the tendency of prey avoiding predators by dispersing into adjacent patches with fewer predators, while PP describes the tendency of predators to pursue the prey by moving into patches with more prey. Based on the Beddington predation model, a spatially explicit metapopulation model was built to incorporate PE and PP. Numerical simulations were run to investigate the effects of PE and PP on the rate of spread, spatial synchrony and the persistence of populations. Results show that both PE and PP can alter spatial synchrony although PP has a weaker desynchronising effect than PE. The predator-prey system without PE and PP expanded in circular waves. The effect of PE can push the prey to distribute in a circular ring front, whereas the effect of PP can change the circular waves to a nisotropic expansion. Furthermore, weak PE and PP can accelerate the spread of prey while strong and disproportionate intensities slow down the range expansion. The effects of PE and PP further enhance the population size, break down the spatial synchrony and promote the persistence of populations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the environmental drivers and the demographic mechanisms of the widespread decline in marine survival rates of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) over the last four decades. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian life cycle model to quantify the spatial synchrony in the marine survival of 13 large groups of populations (called stock units, SU) from two continental stock groups (CSG) in North America (NA) and Southern Europe (SE) over the period 1971-2014. We found strong coherence in the temporal variation in postsmolt marine survival among the 13 SU of NA and SE. A common North Atlantic trend explains 37% of the temporal variability of the survivals for the 13 SU and declines by a factor of 1.8 over the 1971-2014 time series. Synchrony in survival trends is stronger between SU within each CSG. The common trends at the scale of NA and SE capture 60% and 42% of the total variance of temporal variations, respectively. Temporal variations of the postsmolt survival are best explained by the temporal variations of sea surface temperature (SST, negative correlation) and net primary production indices (PP, positive correlation) encountered by salmon in common domains during their marine migration. Specifically, in the Labrador Sea/Grand Banks for populations from NA, 26% and 24% of variance is captured by SST and PP, respectively and in the Norwegian Sea for populations from SE, 21% and 12% of variance is captured by SST and PP, respectively.

These ecotones are characterized by highly dynamic physico-chemical and hydro-morphologic conditions, resulting in a mosaic of habitats in which species are particularly well adapted to variability. However, sandy beach ecotones occurring along estuarine gradients are rarely addressed from the TW perspective. We conducted a 2-yr study to assess the seasonal dynamics of environmental and macrofaunal descriptors in 16 sandy beaches of the Uruguayan coast in TW defined by the widest estuary of the world (Rio de la Plata). A strong variability in environmental conditions was found at inner estuarine beaches, reflecting the seasonal dynamics of the estuarine discharge. The greatest abundance and species richness found in dissipative oceanic beaches were also characterized by their lowest temporal variability, indicating that macrofaunal communities were more stable towards oceanic conditions, where environmental variability was also lowest. Spatial synchrony was reflected in changes across seasons in the species richness in the TW system. A high turnover of species along spatio-temporal gradients occurring within the TW ecotone was observed. Mollusca and Polychaeta were absent in highly-variable estuarine beaches, irrespective of the morphodynamic state. A functional equivalence between species was found at the extremes of the salinity gradient. The environmental variables that best explained community patterns differed among seasons: in summer and autumn, salinity, wave period and beach width were the main explanatory factors, whereas temperature had a primary influence in winter and morphodynamic variables exerted a major influence in autumn. We highlight the need to consider concurrent variations in estuarine and morphodynamic variables when assessing the spatial distribution of macrofaunal species richness and abundance in sandy beaches occurring along TW.

Understanding the degree to which harvest-induced impacts increase the sensitivity of individuals, populations and ultimately species to environmental change is essential to ensuring sustainable fisheries management in a rapidly changing world. Here we generated multiple long-term (44-62 years), annually resolved, somatic growth chronologies of four commercially important fishes from New Zealand's coastal and shelf waters. We used these novel data to investigate how regional- and basin-scale environmental variability, in concert with fishing activity, affected individual somatic growth rates and the magnitude of spatial synchrony among stocks. Changes in somatic growth can affect individual fitness and a range of population and fishery metrics such as recruitment success, maturation schedules and stock biomass. Across all species, individual growth benefited from a fishing-induced release of density controls. For nearshore snapper and tarakihi, regional-scale wind and temperature also additively affected growth, indicating that future climate change-induced warming and potentially strengthened winds will initially promote the productivity of more poleward populations. Fishing increased the sensitivity of deep-water hoki and ling growth to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). A forecast shift to a positive IPO phase, in concert with current harvest strategies, will likely promote individual hoki and ling growth. At the species level, historical fishing practices and IPO synergized to strengthen spatial synchrony in average growth between stocks separated by 400-600 nm of ocean. Increased spatial synchrony can, however, increase the vulnerability of stocks to deleterious stochastic events. Together, our individual- and species-level results show how fishing and environmental factors can conflate to initially promote individual growth but then possibly heighten the sensitivity of stocks to environmental change.",,,,,"; Morrongiello, John/E-8716-2011","Sutton, Phil/0000-0003-2936-0918; Morrongiello, John/0000-0002-9608-4151",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,APR,2021,27,7,,,,,1470,1484,,10.1111/gcb.15490,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15490,,JAN 2021,,,,,,33502819,,,,,WOS:000612141700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a previous study, we determined that local-scale (< 15km) spatial synchrony of bird populations in New England was correlated with synchronous fluctuations in lepidopteran larvae abundance and with the North Atlantic Oscillation. Here we address five questions that extend the scope of our earlier study using North American Breeding Bird Survey data. First, do bird populations in eastern North America exhibit spatial synchrony in abundances at scales beyond those we have documented previously? Second, does spatial synchrony depend on what population metric is analyzed ( e. g., abundance, growth rate, or variability)? Third, is there geographic concordance in where species exhibit synchrony? Fourth, for those species that exhibit significant geographic concordance, are there landscape and habitat variables that contribute to the observed patterns? Fifth, is spatial synchrony affected by a species' life history traits? Significant spatial synchrony was common and its magnitude was dependent on the population metric analyzed. Twenty-four of 29 species examined exhibited significant synchrony in population abundance: mean local autocorrelation (rho) = 0.15; mean spatial extent ( mean distance where rho = 0) = 420.7 km. Five of the 29 species exhibited significant synchrony in annual population growth rate ( mean local autocorrelation 0.06, mean distance 457.8 km). Ten of the 29 species exhibited significant synchrony in population abundance variability ( mean local autocorrelation 0.49, mean distance 413.8 km). Analyses of landscape structure indicated that habitat variables were infrequent contributors to spatial synchrony. Likewise, we detected no effects of life history traits on synchrony in population abundance or growth rate. However, short-distance migrants exhibited more spatially extensive synchrony in population variability than either year-round residents or long-distance migrants. The dissimilarity of the spatial extent of synchrony across species suggests that most populations are not regulated at similar spatial scales. The spatial scale of the population synchrony patterns we describe is likely larger than the actual scale of population regulation, and in turn, the scale of population regulation is undoubtedly larger than the scale of individual ecological requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,OCT,2007,88,10,,,,,2505,2515,,10.1890/06-1514.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1514.1,,,,,,,,18027754,,,,,WOS:000250714200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

To analyse synchrony patterns, only the three highest spatial scales were considered, but for temporal population variability, all spatial scales were adopted. The synchrony-distance relationship revealed complex spatial structures depending on both species and spatial scale. Temporal population variability [SD log(x+1)] levels were highest at the smallest spatial scales although, in the majority of the cases, temporal variability was inversely dependent on sample size.

Synchrony in population changes was quantified by correlation among series of abundance categorised on quantitative scales. Two periods were analysed separately, pre- and post-1992, following changes in methods and extent of monitoring. Positive average correlations among sites were found for 10 out of 16 species pre-1992 and for 23 out of 26 post-1992, statistically significant for 4 and 8 species for the 2 periods, respectively. The intertidal barnacle Semibalanus balanoides showed most synchrony among sites for both periods, while dogwhelks Nucella lapillus and macroalgae (Fucus vesiculosus, F serratus, Mastocarpus stellatus) had very low average correlations among sites. Littorina saxatilis was the only other species with significant positive correlation among sites in both periods. Corallinaceae, Verrucaria maura and V mucosa, and Littorina neglecta were less synchronised pre-1992 than post-1992, while L. obtusata showed less synchrony post-1992. Differences in reproductive biology and ecology failed to explain patterns of synchrony among species. Species with planktonic larvae were no more likely to be synchronised than those without. There was a tendency for species living higher on the shore to be more synchronised post-1992, but species predominant on wave-exposed shores were no more synchronous than sheltered-shore species. The more synchronised species in this study need to be monitored at relatively few sites to detect change, whereas more sites may be needed for species in which change occurs on a local scale. Population synchrony also suggested usefulness of species as indicators of large-scale change: the barnacle S. balanoides is the best indicator among species in the study area.",,,,,"Burrows, Michael/ABF-4844-2020; Burrows, Michael/D-9844-2013","Burrows, Michael/0000-0003-4620-5899",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,,,,,,2002,240,,,,,,39,48,,10.3354/meps240039,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps240039,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000178457600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Spatial synchrony can exhibit complex spatial structures, termed 'geographies of synchrony', that can reveal mechanisms underlying population fluctuations. However, most studies have focused on spatial extents of 10s to 100s of kilometres, making it unclear how synchrony concepts and approaches should apply to dynamics at finer spatial scales. We used network analyses, multiple regression on similarity matrices, and wavelet coherence analyses to examine micro-scale synchrony and geographies of synchrony, over distances up to 30 m, in a serpentine grassland plant community. We found that species' populations exhibited a geography of synchrony even over such short distances. Often, well-synchronized populations were geographically separate, a spatial structure that was shaped mainly by gopher disturbance and dispersal limitation, and to a lesser extent by relationships with other plant species. Precipitation was a significant driver of site- and community-wide temporal dynamics. Gopher disturbance appeared to drive synchrony on 2- to 6-year timescales, and we detected coherent fluctuations among pairs of focal plant taxa. Synthesis.

One can let several samples represent the same population over larger areas, or alternatively model the dynamics of each sampling location in continuous space. We analysed the spatio-temporal population dynamics of six phytoplankton taxa in the Baltic Sea applying multivariate state-space models with first-order density dependence. We compared three spatial scales and three models for spatial correlation between predefined subpopulations using information theoretic model selection. We hypothesised that populations close to each other display similar dynamic properties and spatial synchrony decreasing with the distance. We further hypothesize that intermediate-scale grouping of data into subpopulations may parsimoniously represent such dynamics. All taxa showed constant density dependence across space and strong spatial synchrony, consistently requiring a parameter for spatial correlation whenever models included several population states. The most parsimonious spatial structure varied between taxa, most often being one panmictic population or ten intercorrelated population states.

We developed a network model of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with an additional dependency on ATP dynamics. Neurons were scattered in a 2D space, and their population activity patterns at varying ATP levels were simulated. The model predicted a decrease in firing activity as the ATP production rate was lowered. Under hypometabolic conditions, an oscillatory firing pattern, that is, an ON-OFF cycle arose through a failure of sustainable firing due to reduced excitatory positive feedback and rebound firing after the slow recovery of ATP concentration. The firing rate oscillation of distant neurons developed at first asynchronously that changed into burst suppression and global synchronization as ATP production further decreased. These changes resembled the experimental data obtained from anesthetized rats, as an example of a metabolically suppressed brain.

In reference sites, trait compositions changed differently (were less similar over time) in response to extreme events and variation was less synchronic than taxonomic compositions in the same sites. Oppositely, in disturbed sites there was a marked synchrony in trait composition indicating a functional homogenization in response to human pressures.

J,"Engen, S",,,,"Engen, Steinar",,,Spatial synchrony and harvesting in fluctuating populations: Relaxing the small noise assumption,THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"In spatio-temporal population dynamic models, the most important concept, in addition to mean and variance of local density fluctuations, is the spatial scale of fluctuations in density expressed by studying the spatial autocovariance function. Analytical formulas for this scale in models with local density regulation, dispersal and spatially autocorrelated noise, are rather simple when based on asymptotic theory giving linear models in the limit as the environmental variance approaches zero. The accuracy of these analytical small noise approximations has, however, not been investigated theoretically. Here, we work out improved approximations for the scale as well the spatial autocorrelation function using non-linear logistic local dynamics and going to the next order of approximation with respect to the environmental variance. Generally, it turns out that the asymptotic results are remarkably accurate under moderate fluctuations in density but may be inaccurate for very large fluctuations. For populations with small dispersal capacity, the main error comes from the fact that the logistic dynamics is non-linear, and this error is partly wiped out as dispersal increases. Proportional harvesting has a large effect on the dynamics in spatial as well as non-spatial models, increasing population fluctuations and their spatial scale. The optimal harvesting rate with respect to expected yield per time unit, however, is only to a small extent affected by the magnitude of population fluctuations unless these are very large, so that asymptotic results are applicable over a large range of population fluctuations.

Here we argue that, unlike the Moran effect where spatial synchrony is driven by exogenous factors, spatial correlation in intrinsic/local-scale processes can affect the level of spatial synchrony among distinct sub-populations, and therefore the persistence of the entire population. To explore this mechanism, we modelled the consequences of spatial heterogeneity in aquatic habitat quality, and that of temporal variation in local extinction probability, on the persistence of stage-structured mosquito populations. As a model system, we used two widely distributed mosquito species, Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens, both key vectors of a range of infectious diseases. Spatial heterogeneity in aquatic habitat quality led to increased population persistence, and this pattern was more pronounced at intermediate dispersal rates, and in the long-dispersing species (C.pipiens). The highest regional persistence was obtained at high dispersal rates. This is probably because dispersal, in our model, did not carry any additional costs. Population persistence of both species was negatively correlated with increased temporal variation in local extinction probability. These differences were stronger in the short-dispersing species (A.albopictus), especially at intermediate dispersal rates. The dispersal of A.albopictus adults in each time step was limited to the nearest habitat patches, weakening the positive effect of spatial heterogeneity in aquatic habitat quality on population persistence. In contrast, C.pipiens adults could disperse into more remote sub-populations, resulting in much higher recolonization rates. Hence, the negative effect of temporal variation in local extinction probability on patch occupancy disappeared at intermediate dispersal rates. We suggest that effectively controlling these two mosquito species requires making few spatially synchronized control efforts (i.e., generating high temporal variation in local extinction probability), rather than many asynchronized local control efforts. Finally, our model can be easily fitted to other organisms characterized by complex life cycles, and it can be also used to examine alternative scenarios, including the effect of spatial configuration of local habitat patches and dispersal kernel shape on population persistence.",,,,,"Ovadia, Ofer/C-8292-2012","Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947; Tsurim, Ido/0000-0002-8510-3089",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,DEC,2017,27,8,,,,,2342,2358,,10.1002/eap.1612,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.1612,,,,,,,,28851019,,,,,WOS:000416862700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using 15 years of data on the abundances of songbirds at four replicate forest sites in New Hampshire, USA, we addressed two main questions: (1) Are forest bird populations synchronous at the scale measured (tens of kilometers), and if so, (2) what environmental factors are responsible for the synchrony? Nine of the 10 bird species we examined exhibited significant spatial synchrony across the four sites. Within nesting and foraging species groups, tree nesters and foliage gleaners exhibited the highest spatial synchrony. Long-distance (Neotropical) migrants exhibited higher spatial synchrony than did short-distance migrants or year-round residents. Synchrony within and among six species of long-distance, migratory, insectivorous birds was correlated with synchronous fluctuations in the abundance of lepidopteran larvae, a primary food type during the breeding season, which in turn have been shown to be influenced by El Nino/La Nina global climate patterns. Abundances of year-round resident species were related to another large-scale climatic phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Winter weather can have both direct (e.g., via temperature-mediated mortality) and indirect (e.g., via winter food availability) effects on year-round resident species. We do not believe that predation on adults or nests accounted for the observed synchrony. Dispersal among regional populations in this system may have played a role but is likely a product of the influence of regionally synchronous caterpillar fluctuations on bird reproduction. Long-term regional population trends may have contributed to the observed synchrony for some species, but we do not consider these trends to be primary factors. Our findings of population synchrony support the importance of food and climate in influencing forest bird abundances and have broad implications for potential responses of bird and insect populations to climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,NOV,2003,84,11,,,,,3024,3032,,10.1890/02-0639,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-0639,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000187363200020,View Full Record in Web of Science

We manipulated the presence/absence of short-distance dispersal and spatially decaying environmental synchrony and examined their separate and interactive effects on the synchrony of the protist prey species Tetrahymena pyriformis growing in spatial arrays of patches (laboratory microcosms).

Dispersal increased prey synchrony uniformly over both short and long distances, and did so by entraining the phases of the predator-prey cycles. The Moran effect also increased prey synchrony, but only over short distances where environmental synchrony was strongest, and did so by increasing the synchrony of stochastic fluctuations superimposed on the predator-prey cycle. Our results provide the first experimental demonstration of distance decay of synchrony due to distance decay of the Moran effect. Distance decay of the Moran effect likely explains distance decay of synchrony in many natural systems. Our results also provide an experimental demonstration of long-distance phase locking, and explain why cyclic populations provide many of the most dramatic examples of long-distance spatial synchrony in nature.",,,,,"Vasseur, David/A-2545-2013; Roberts, Jodie/AAN-7376-2020","Vasseur, David/0000-0003-1706-9613; Roberts, Jodie/0000-0002-8544-3171",,,,,,,,,,,,,1461-023X,1461-0248,,,,FEB,2011,14,2,,,,,163,168,,10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01567.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01567.x,,,,,,,,21155962,,,,,WOS:000286599600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whether spring phenology will continue to advance uniformly at latitudes has not yet been investigated. We used Bayesian model averaging and four spring phenology models, and demonstrated that the start of vegetation growing season across the Northern Hemisphere will become substantially more synchronous (up to 11.3%) under future climatic warming conditions. Larger start of growing season advances are expected at higher than lower latitudes (3.7-10.9 days earlier) due to both larger rate in spring warming at higher latitudes and larger decreases in the temperature sensitivity of start of growing season at low latitudes. The consequent impacts on the northern ecosystems due to this increased synchrony may be considerable and thus worth investigating. Plain Language Summary Recent climatic warming has not only triggered a notable advance of spring phenology over the past decades but also changed the spatial pattern of its temperature sensitivity. Whether the shifts in spring phenology would continue to follow the latitude gradient remains unclear. Based on simulations over the end of this century, we concluded that the advance of spring phenology at high latitudes is larger than the low latitudes, consequently resulting in more synchronous spring phenology. Further analysis suggests that besides greater spring warming at high latitudes, the larger decrease in temperature sensitivity of spring phenology possibly due to shorter day length and chilling loss at low latitudes also contributes to this finding. Our study, therefore, reports the possibility of improving phenological modules in dynamic vegetation models and thus promoting our understanding of the response of northern ecosystem to ongoing climate change.",,,,,"Janssens, Ivan/JAN-7752-2023; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Fu, Yongshuo/AAH-7434-2019; Janssens, Ivan/P-1331-2014","Qiang, Liu/0000-0003-2332-2873; Fu, Yongshuo/0000-0002-9761-5292; Janssens, Ivan/0000-0002-5705-1787",,,,,,,,,,,,,0094-8276,1944-8007,,,,FEB 16,2019,46,3,,,,,1641,1650,,10.1029/2018GL081370,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081370,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000462072800058,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, the role of exogenous factors, and thus the effects of climate change, in regulating microphytobenthic biomass is poorly understood. We aimed to unravel the mechanisms structuring microphytobenthic biomass both within and across ecosystems. The spatiotemporal distribution of the biomass of intertidal benthic algae (dominated by diatoms) was estimated with an unprecedented spatial extent from time-series of Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from a 6-year period of daily Aqua MODIS 250-m images of seven temperate, mostly turbid, estuarine and coastal ecosystems. These NDVI time-series were related to meteorological and environmental conditions. Intertidal benthic algal biomass varied seasonally in all ecosystems, in parallel with meteorology and water quality. Seasonal variation was more pronounced in mud than in sand. Interannual variation in biomass was small, but synchronized year-to-year biomass fluctuations occurred in a number of disjointed ecosystems. Air temperature explained interannual fluctuations in biomass in a number of sites, but the synchrony was mainly driven by the wind/wave climate: high wind velocities reduced microphytobenthic biomass, either through increased resuspension or reduced emersion duration. Spatial variation in biomass was largely explained by emersion duration and mud content, both within and across ecosystems. The results imply that effects on microphytobenthic standing stock can be anticipated when the position in the tidal frame is altered, for example due to sea level rise. Increased storminess will also result in a large-scale decrease of biomass.",,,,,"van der Wal, Daphne/A-8875-2011; Herman, Peter/A-9018-2011","van der Wal, Daphne/0000-0002-2319-056X; Herman, Peter/0000-0003-2188-6341",,,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,,,,,MAR,2010,13,2,,,,,338,351,,10.1007/s10021-010-9322-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-010-9322-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000275785700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

We further examine how climate and topography influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ecotone, showing that ecotone is most prevalent at mid-elevations where the topography leads to moisture accumulation and that climatic moisture availability influences up and downslope interannual variation in ecotone location. We found some evidence for long-term (22 year) trends toward upslope or downslope ecotone shifts, but stronger evidence that regional climate mediates topographic controls on ecotone properties.

Because of the large spatial scales involved, empirical tests to identify the causes of synchrony are often impractical. Simple models are, therefore, a useful aid to understanding, but data often seem to contradict model predictions. For instance, chaotic population dynamics and limited dispersal are not uncommon among synchronous forest defoliators, yet both make it difficult to achieve synchrony in simple models. To test whether this discrepancy can be explained by more realistic models, we introduced dispersal and spatially correlated stochasticity into a mechanistic population model for the North American gypsy moth Lymantria dispar. The resulting model shows both chaotic dynamics and spatial synchrony, suggesting that chaos and synchrony can be reconciled by the incorporation of realistic dynamics and spatial structure. By relating alterations in model structure to changes in synchrony levels, we show that the synchrony is due to a combination of spatial co-variance in environmental stochasticity and the origins of chaos in our multispecies model.",,,,,"Dwyer, Greg/L-1134-2015","Abbott, Karen/0000-0001-5143-0690",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,NOV,2008,172,5,,,,,613,624,,10.1086/591679,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/591679,,,,,,,,18821838,,,,,WOS:000260186000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Location Maryland and Virginia in the eastern United States. Methods Using data from 36 survey sites in Virginia (1973-2000) and Maryland (1977-2000), we described the spatial synchrony of annual acorn production based on Mantel tests and modified correlograms at three spatial scales: (1) the entire study area, (2) within two ecological regions (mountain and Piedmont), and (3) between these ecoregions. Using climate data obtained from the National Climate Data Centre, we described the relationship between climate and acorn production within each ecological region using linear regression. Results Spatial synchrony in the white oak group acorn production was strong among sites closest together, and declined with distance. The average April temperature during the year of acorn drop was positively related to acorn crop size within the mountain and Piedmont ecoregions. Spatial synchrony in the red oak group was strong among sites closest together and declined with distance in the mountain region. Synchrony was weaker in the Piedmont than in the mountain ecoregion and declined slightly with increasing distance. Between the mountain and Piedmont ecoregions, synchrony was not detected among the closest sites, but was detected with increasing strength as the distance between site pairs increased. In the Piedmont ecoregion, the number of April freeze events and total July precipitation, both 2 years prior to acorn drop, were negatively related to red oak acorn production. In the mountains, average July temperature 2 years prior to acorn drop was positively related to acorn production. Main conclusions Physiographic differences affected the spatial acorn production synchrony in the red oak but not in the white oak subgenus group. Climatic factors related to annual acorn production variability differed between subgenus groups and physiographic regions. The physiographic differences between the mountain and Piedmont ecoregions may define spatial patterns of acorn production synchrony in some oak species and mediate climatic influences on acorn production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,NOV,2008,35,11,,,,,2012,2025,,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01960.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.01960.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000260016000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Population synchrony has been assessed for only a few species of vertebrates, most of them have largely fluctuating populations with multiannual cycles. We investigated the intensity and spatial extent of synchrony among populations of birds in Britain. The data analyzed ran from 1962 to 1995 at more than 100 local sites and concerned 60 species. For each species, we measured the intensity of synchrony among local populations using the cross-correlation function (CCF) and assessed its spatial extent. We tested for differences in these two measures with respect to habitat. We also assessed the potential influence of long-term trends in population synchrony. By aggregating the sites in regions and estimating an index for each region, we measured synchrony at a large spatial scale. In general, we found that synchrony was low between populations of British birds. All but one species with the strongest level of synchrony show a pronounced long-term decline. The mean CCF was significantly correlated with the mean abundance of each species in the Common Birds Census (CBC) sites, suggesting that the more abundant species have more synchronous populations. Significant differences in synchrony between habitats were found in 25 species; synchrony was stronger in farmlands compared to woodlands for 22 species. The same result was observed both at the intra- and interspecific levels. This may be the result of national change in agricultural practice affecting all farmland populations. Our cross-scale analysis showed that synchrony is a scale-dependent phenomenon. Our study is the first to focus on a large number of noncyclic species, and it suggests that synchrony is weaker for these species than for those with widely fluctuating cyclic populations. This is in agreement with some studies on synchrony of insects. Synchrony in natural populations seems to be determined by complex interactions between abundance, population variability, species characteristics, and demographic mechanisms.

Two-thirds of boreal forests are in Siberia, where peatlands commonly appear mixed with mineral soils. Siberian forests are currently facing a dual shift in environmental conditions regarding climate change and increased fire activity. Therefore, assessing growth patterns of trees subjected to different disturbance regimes is essential to understand the impact of ongoing environmental changes on forest functioning. Following a dendroecological approach, we aimed at analyzing spatial synchrony ((a) over cap (C)) patterns of trees subjected to different ecohydrological and fire disturbance conditions in forests of Pinus sylvestris of south-western Siberia. Furthermore, we assessed growth suppression as a proxy for fire occurrence based on tree-ring width chronologies after removing climate signals. Our results endorsed climate as the main driver of (a) over cap (C), which showed different trends depending on substrate type. A release of temperature constraints in the more temperature-limited peat soils led to decreasing (a) over cap (C) from mid-1960s onwards, while the opposite pattern was found in mineral soils where stronger reliance on summer precipitation progressively increased (a) over cap (C). However, frequently burned stands suffered a sharp reduction in (a) over cap (C) since 1980s likely due to the decoupling of growth from climate as a result of an increase in fire activity. Strong replication of growth suppressions supported by historical and palaeoecological records pointed to 1915, 1952, 1977, 1983, 2003 and 2012 as potential fire years.

I measured persistence of predator and prey protists in replicated microcosms with two to four patches. Predators persisted for 85-437 generations (26-130 d). As predicted by single-species and/or predator-prey metapopulation models, substantial variation in predator metapopulation persistence was accounted for by the amount of patches or habitat, number of dispersal corridors, maximum interpatch distance, and proportion of patches providing colonists (which depends on the explicit spatial arrangement of patches). Contrary to expectation, persistence was not influenced by loops of patches or patch similarity. Persistence was also shorter in four-patch loops than three-patch loops, indicating an interaction between patch number and arrangement, which is not predicted by published models. Spatial synchrony of density fluctuations was central to predator persistence but had complex effects on extinction-colonization dynamics, rescue effects, and predator-prey interaction strength. Levins's model, containing only extinction-colonization dynamics, predicted patch occupancy for prey but not predators. Predators did, however, show rescue effects and changes in interaction strength.

For migratory species, in particular, it is also essential to consider the extent of spatial synchrony among separate breeding populations in range-wide predictions. We develop a quantitative method to evaluate the accuracy of climate-based ecological predictions and use this approach to assess the extent of spatio-temporal synchrony among distinct regions within the breeding range of a single migratory population. Location We model weekly site-specific summer abundances (1996-2011) of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in the Midwestern USA as a function of climate conditions experienced during a shared spring migration/ breeding phase in Texas and separate summer recruitment periods in Ohio and Illinois. Methods Using negative binomial regression models, we evaluate spatio-temporal synchrony between monarchs in the two states and develop a novel quantitative assessment approach to determine the temporal predictive strength of our model with Bayesian P-values. Results Monarchs breeding in the Midwest exhibit spatio-temporal synchrony in Ohio and Illinois; cooler spring temperatures, average to above average precipitation in Texas and cooler than average summer temperatures are associated with higher population abundances in both states. At least 10 years of data are needed for adequate model predictability of average future counts. Because annual spring weather conditions in Texas primarily drive yearly abundances, as opposed to localized summer effects, year-specific counts are often difficult to predict reliably, specifically when predictive spring conditions are outside the range of typical regional conditions. Main conclusions Our assessment method can be used in similar analyses to more confidently interpret ecological responses to climate change.

One of the main uncertainties in global change predictions lies in how the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest productivity will be affected by climate warming. Here we show an increasing influence of climate on the spatial variability of tree growth during the last 120 y, ultimately leading to unprecedented temporal coherence in ring-width records over wide geographical scales (spatial synchrony). Synchrony in growth patterns across cold-constrained (central Siberia) and drought-constrained (Spain) Eurasian conifer forests have peaked in the early 21st century at subcontinental scales (similar to 1,000 km). Such enhanced synchrony is similar to that observed in trees co-occurring within a stand. In boreal forests, the combined effects of recent warming and increasing intensity of climate extremes are enhancing synchrony through an earlier start of wood formation and a stronger impact of year-to-year fluctuations of growing-season temperatures on growth. In Mediterranean forests, the impact of warming on synchrony is related mainly to an advanced onset of growth and the strengthening of drought-induced growth limitations.

Here we investigate the effects of intra- and interspecific density-dependent dispersal on the regional stability in a predator-prey metacommunity model. We show that, when the dynamics of the populations reach equilibrium, the stability of the metacommunity is not affected by density-dependent dispersal. However, the regional stability, measured as the regional variability or the persistence, can be modified by density-dependent dispersal when local populations fluctuate over time. Moreover these effects depend on the relative dispersal of the predator and the prey. Regional stability is modified through changes in spatial synchrony. Interspecific density-dependent dispersal always desynchronizses local dynamics, whereas intraspecific density-dependent dispersal may either synchronize or desynchronize it depending on dispersal rates. Moreover, intra- and interspecific density-dependent dispersal strengthen the top-down control of the prey by the predator at intermediate dispersal rates. As a consequence the regional stability of the metacommunity is increased at intermediate dispersal rates.

This regime shift has been attributed to climate change. Plankton provide a link between climate and higher trophic-level organisms, which can forage on large spatial and temporal scales. It is therefore important to understand not only whether climate change affects purely spatial or temporal aspects of plankton dynamics, but also whether it affects spatiotemporal aspects such as metapopulation synchrony. If plankton synchrony is altered, higher trophic-level feeding patterns may be modified. A second motivation for investigating changes in synchrony is that the possibility of such alterations has been examined for few organisms, in spite of the fact that synchrony is ubiquitous and of major importance in ecology. This study uses correlation coefficients and spectral analysis to investigate whether synchrony changed between the periods 1959-1980 and 1989-2010. Twenty-three plankton taxa, sea surface temperature (SST), and wind speed were examined. Results revealed that synchrony in SST and plankton was altered. Changes were idiosyncratic, and were not explained by changes in abundance. Changes in the synchrony of Calanus helgolandicus and Para-pseudocalanus spp appeared to be driven by changes in SST synchrony.

Weather and habitat heterogeneity influence forest insect population dynamics at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Comparison of forest insect population dynamics in two principal host species may elucidate the relative contribution of weather and landscape factors in initiating and driving extensive outbreaks. To investigate potential drivers of the current MPB outbreak, we compared broadscale spatiotemporal patterns of MPB activity in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) from 1996 to 2010 in Colorado and southern Wyoming with regional weather fluctuations, and then tracked the annual meso-scale progression of the epidemic in lodgepole pine with respect to weather, topographic, previous MPB activity, and forest stand attributes. MPB activity in lodgepole pine compared to ponderosa pine showed higher magnitude and extent of spatial synchrony. Warm temperatures and low annual precipitation favorable to beetle populations showed high regional synchrony across areas of both pine species, suggesting that habitat interacts with weather in synchronizing MPB populations. Cluster analysis of time series patterns identified multiple, disjunct locations of incipient MPB activity (epicenters) in lodgepole pine, which overlapped an earlier 1980s MPB outbreak, and suggests a regional trigger (drought) across this homogenous forest type. Negative departures from mean annual precipitation played a key role in subsequent spread of MPB outbreak. Development of the outbreak was also associated with lower elevations, greater dominance by lodgepole pine, stands of larger tree size, and stands with higher percentage canopy cover. After epidemic levels of MPB activity were attained, MPB activity was less strongly associated with stand and weather variables.

The three communities were connected at either no, low (0.7% per day), or high (20% per day) planktonic dispersal. Results demonstrate that heterogeneous predation (1) prevents spatial synchrony among prey populations across local communities, (2) disrupts the synchronous population dynamics within communities produced by dispersal, and (3) induces local compensatory dynamics between species within communities regardless of dispersal rate.

Understanding the spatio-temporal patterns of eruptive insects can provide insights into the mechanisms driving their dynamics and help predict future responses under climate change. The aims of this study were to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of outbreaks of the woodwasp Sirex noctilio -a major invasive pest of pines- in an invaded region of South America, to assess the relative importance of density-dependent and density-independent mechanisms on population dynamics, and to identify the primary factors that influence the magnitude of outbreaks. We used tree ring and insect sampling data of more than 1000 trees to reconstruct S. noctilio outbreaks in 29 pine stands across Patagonia-Argentina over a 16-year period. We found marked spatial synchrony in S. noctilio outbreaks at a regional scale. Rates of tree mortality from S. noctilio were influenced by both density-dependent and density-independent factors. The occurrence of S. noctilio outbreaks are triggered by an abrupt increase in drought, which likely increases the availability of susceptible host trees.

Rates of tree mortality decreased over time due to negative density-dependence in S. noctilio populations, likely due to the loss of suitable resources over time.

Fifteen (63%) of the bird species exhibited numerical changes in abundance apparently associated with emergences of the local periodical cicada brood, and intraspecific spatial synchrony of bird abundance was significantly greater between populations sharing the same cicada brood than between populations in the ranges of different broods. Species exhibited at least four partially overlapping temporal patterns. (I) Cuckoos (Coccyzus spp.) occurred in high numbers only during emergence years and subsequently declined in abundance. (2) Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus), Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata), Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), and Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) increased significantly 1-3 years following emergences and then declined. (3) Red-headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), American Crows (Corvus brachyrynchos), Tufted Titmice (Baeolophus bicolor), Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis), and Brown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum) were found in significantly low numbers during emergence years, underwent significant numerical increases in the following year, and then stabilized. (4) Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), Northern Mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos), Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) exhibited significantly deviant population numbers 1-2 years prior to emergences, below the long-term mean in the first two species and above the long-term mean in the latter two.

N.",,,Dispersal synchronizes giant kelp forests,ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spatial synchrony is the tendency for population fluctuations to be correlated among different locations. This phenomenon is a ubiquitous feature of population dynamics and is important for ecosystem stability, but several aspects of synchrony remain unresolved. In particular, the extent to which any particular mechanism, such as dispersal, contributes to observed synchrony in natural populations has been difficult to determine. To address this gap, we leveraged recent methodological improvements to determine how dispersal structures synchrony in giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), a global marine foundation species that has served as a useful system for understanding synchrony. We quantified population synchrony and fecundity with satellite imagery across 11 years and 880 km of coastline in southern California, USA, and estimated propagule dispersal probabilities using a high-resolution ocean circulation model. Using matrix regression models that control for the influence of geographic distance, resources (seawater nitrate), and disturbance (destructive waves), we discovered that dispersal was an important driver of synchrony. Our findings were robust to assumptions about propagule mortality during dispersal and consistent between two metrics of dispersal: (1) the individual probability of dispersal and (2) estimates of demographic connectivity that incorporate fecundity (the number of propagules dispersing). We also found that dispersal and environmental conditions resulted in geographic clusters with distinct patterns of synchrony. This study is among the few to statistically associate synchrony with dispersal in a natural population and the first to do so in a marine organism. The synchronizing effects of dispersal and environmental conditions on foundation species, such as giant kelp, likely have cascading effects on the spatial stability of biodiversity and ecosystem function.",,,,,"Castorani, Max/LDE-5681-2024; Bell, Tom/AAD-2551-2020","Walter, Jonathan/0000-0003-2983-751X; Bell, Tom/0000-0002-0173-2866",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,APR,2024,105,4,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.4270,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.4270,,FEB 2024,,,,,,38415343,,,,,WOS:001174304400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Norway, the 3-4 year lemming cycle usually show no more than a one-year time lag between different regions, despite distances of up to 1000 km. If important food plants are forced to reallocate defensive proteins in years with high seed production, spatially synchronized herbivore outbreaks may be due to climate-synchronized peaks in flowering. Because lemming peaks are expected to occur one year after a flowering peak, and the formation of flower buds is induced in the year before flowering, a two-year time lag between flower-inducing climate events and lemming peaks is predicted. At Hardangervidda, South Norway, the probability that a year was a population peak year of lemming during 1920-2014 increased with increasing midsummer atmospheric pressure two years earlier, even when the number of years since the previous peak was accounted for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,JUN 1,2016,6,,,,,,,,27225,10.1038/srep27225,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep27225,,,,,,,,27249449,,,,,WOS:000377166000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The fungal pathogen Podosphaera plantaginis persists as a dynamic metapopulation in the large network of Plantago lanceolata host populations. Here, we analyze long-term data to measure the spatial synchrony of epidemics and consequences of infection for over 4000 host populations. Using a theoretical model, we study whether large-scale environmental change could synchronize disease occurrence across the metapopulation. During 2001-2013 exposure to freezing decreased, while pathogen extinction-colonization-persistence rates became more synchronized. Simulations of a theoretical model suggest that increasingly favorable winter conditions for pathogen survival could drive such synchronization. Our data also show that infection decreases host population growth.

This synchrony and its spatial patterns can have important consequences for the long-term persistence of metapopulations and can also be used to infer drivers of population dynamics. Here, we examined spatial patterns of synchrony in the breeding success of black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla in the UK, using an extensive dataset on kittiwake breeding success and 2 different ways of measuring synchrony: one reflecting synchrony in inter-annual fluctuations only (r(diff)) and one reflecting synchrony in both inter-annual fluctuations and long-term trends (r). We found that between-colony synchrony in breeding success decreased with distance up to just over 200 km but that some colony pairs showed stronger or weaker synchrony than expected based on distance. This was also reflected in the configuration of spatially coherent clusters of kittiwake colonies with synchronous breeding success. Further, we compared the support for different drivers of these spatial patterns, including trophic interactions and weather conditions. We found that the spatial dynamics of the kittiwakes' main prey in this region, the lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus, appeared to play some role in generating synchrony in long-term patterns, but their role in generating synchrony in inter-annual fluctuations was less clear.

Its application to natural systems is still limited by the complexity of ecological time series displaying great variation in the frequency and amplitude of their fluctuations, which are not fully resolved by current ecological theories of spatial synchrony. In particular, while environmental fluctuations and limited dispersal can each control the dynamics of frequency and amplitude of population fluctuations, ecological theories of spatial synchrony still need to resolve their role on synchrony and stability in heterogeneous metacommunities. Here, we adopt a heterogeneous predator-prey metacommunity model and study the response of dispersal-driven phase locking and frequency modulation to among-patch heterogeneity in carrying capacity. We find that frequency modulation occurs at intermediate values of dispersal and habitat heterogeneity. We also show how frequency modulation can emerge in metacommunities of autonomously oscillating populations as well as through the forcing of local communities at equilibrium. Frequency modulation was further found to produce temporal variation in population amplitudes, promoting local and regional stability through cyclic patterns of local and regional variability. Our results highlight the importance of approaching spatial synchrony as a non-stationary phenomenon, with implications for the assessment and interpretation of spatial synchrony observed in experimental and natural systems.

For example, the ongoing mountain pine beetle outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has resulted in mortality of mature lodgepole pine over > 7 million ha. Analysis of the spatio-temporal pattern of spread can lend insights into the processes initiating and/or sustaining such phenomena. We present a landscape level analysis of the development of the current outbreak. Aerial survey assessments of tree mortality, projected onto discrete 12x12 km cells, were used as a proxy for insect population density. We examined whether the outbreak potentially originated from an epicenter and spread, or whether multiple localized populations erupted simultaneously at spatially disjunct locations. An aspatial cluster analysis of time series from 1990 to 2003 revealed four distinct time series patterns. Each time series demonstrated a general progression of increasing mountain pine beetle populations. Plotting the geographical locations of each temporal pattern revealed that the outbreak occurred first in an area of west-central British Columbia, and then in an area to the east. The plot further revealed many localized infestations erupted in geographically disjunct areas, especially in the southern portion of the province. Autologistic regression analyses indicated a significant, positive association between areas where the outbreak first occurred and conservation lands. For example, the delineated area of west-central British Columbia is comprised of three conservation parks and adjacent working forest. We further examined how population synchrony declines with distance at different population levels. Examination of the spatial dependence of temporal synchrony in population fluctuations during early, incipient years (i.e. 1990-1996) suggested that outbreaking mountain pine beetle populations are largely independent at scales > 200 km during non-epidemic periods. However, during epidemic years (i.e. 1999-2003), populations were clearly synchronous across the entire province, even at distances of up to 900 km. The epicentral pattern of population development can be used to identify and prioritize adjacent landscape units for both reactive and proactive management strategies intended to minimize mountain pine beetle impacts.",,,,,"Taylor, Steve/KIB-8329-2024",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,JUN,2006,29,3,,,,,427,441,,10.1111/j.2006.0906-7590.04445.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2006.0906-7590.04445.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000238144400016,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the lack of long-term and global baseline perspectives on spatial synchrony presents a challenge to understanding the importance of these trends. Here, we show a steady rise in the spatial synchrony of annual tree growth from a global tree ring database over the past 50 years that is consistent across continents, species and environmental conditions and is unprecedented for the past millennium. Increasing growth synchrony coincided with warming trends and potentially rising synchrony in the temperature records.

Tests for independence generally have relied on assuming a particular dynamic model for each of the series, and those that do not, require long series. We adapt a test for association between spatial processes to provide a model-free (MF) test for independence between two time series under the assumption that each series is stationary and normally distributed. We evaluate the performance of the test through simulations and compare it with the naive (N) test, which ignores serial correlations, as well as with tests based on residuals from fitting specific dynamic models. We also consider additional tests that involve bootstrapping the MF and N tests. We find that the MF test generally preserves the desired test size, although this is not the case in some extreme settings. The MF test is clearly superior to residual-based tests that arise from fitting an incorrect model. The bootstrap tests are not as robust as the general MF test, but when they are valid, they seem to be more powerful. We also examine the robustness of the procedure to the additional measurement errors present in many applications, explore the extent to which some deficiencies in the MF test are due to estimation of the unknown covariances, and investigate the effect of nonnormality on the MF test.

The regional synchrony hypothesis (RSH) states that synchrony in microtine abundance over large geographical areas is caused by nomadic avian predators that specialize on small mammals for food. This has proved a difficult hypothesis to test because experiments at an appropriate scale are almost impossible. 2. We used the decline of the most abundant, nomadic vole-eating raptors in an extensive conifer forest in northern England (Kielder Forest) as a natural experiment to evaluate their influence on synchronizing voles at different spatial scales. Field vole populations fluctuated on a 3-4-year cycle of abundance, similar to the periodicity in central Fennoscandia. 3. Over a 23-year period, the combined numbers and density of kestrels and short-eared owls significantly declined. If these raptors were responsible for synchronizing vole abundance, the decline should have been associated with a decrease in synchrony. We could find no change in synchrony during the period of the greatest decline in kestrel and short-eared owl numbers (1980-97). 4. In Kielder, vole abundance has been shown to change in a wave-like manner, with synchrony in the direction of the wave being 5-10-fold smaller than that reported in Fennoscandia. Tawny owls are sedentary and the most abundant vole-eating raptor in our study area, and might have an equalizing influence on vole abundance over smaller areas if they foraged in a density-dependent manner and responded functionally to increasing vole density. If this was the case, spatial variability in vole density should have been less in occupied than unoccupied owl territories, especially in years of low vole density when owls could take a larger proportion of the standing crop of voles. Even though tawny owls caught a significant proportion of the vole population, we could find no difference in variation in vole density between owl territories that were unoccupied, occupied with no breeding attempt, or occupied with a successful breeding attempt. 5. We conclude that the small-scale synchrony in field vole abundance is unlikely to be caused by avian predators. Instead, it is more likely to be related to the pattern of clear-cutting that has developed in Kielder, which restricts vole dispersal. If this assumption is correct, we would predict more widespread synchrony in vole abundance in first-generation forests when extensive areas are planted over short periods of time, and this is supported by anecdotal evidence. These conclusions indicate that foresters may be able to manipulate the spatial dynamics of voles and vole predators by varying patch sizes within forests.",,,,,"Lambin, Xavier/E-8284-2011","Lambin, Xavier/0000-0003-4643-2653; Thomas, Christopher J./0000-0003-4939-9959",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,,,,,SEP,2000,37,,,1,,,136,147,,10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00473.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00473.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000089917500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recreational fisheries are traditionally managed at local scales, but more effective management could be achieved using a cross-scale approach. To do this, we must first understand how local processes scale up to influence landscape patterns between anglers and resources. We highlight how population-based synchrony methods, used in conjunction with a complex-adaptive-systems framework, can reveal emergent spatial properties within social-ecological systems such as recreational fisheries. 2. Herein, we quantified the level of spatial synchrony in angler behaviour, defined the relationship between angler synchrony and distance among waterbodies, and highlighted social-ecological attributes contributing to these patterns. We leveraged a 111 waterbody-year (34 waterbodies, 5-year collection period) recreational fisheries dataset from Nebraska, USA to address these objectives. 3. Intra-annual patterns in angler behaviour were moderately synchronous across large spatial scales and predominately unrelated to distance among waterbodies. Large-scale synchronous patterns in angler behaviour emerged from local-scale interactions between angler heterogeneity and waterbody diversity. 4. Spatial synchrony in angler behaviour is an emergent property that resulted from local-level processes that scaled up to form large-scale patterns. We posit that angler utility in combination with waterbodies sharing these desired utility components caused spatial synchrony among anglers with similar preferences or specializations. The level of spatial synchrony in angler behaviour will therefore depend on the degree of angler heterogeneity and waterbody diversity on the landscape, with high or low levels of both leading to low and high levels of spatial synchrony respectively. 5. Synthesis and applications. Synchrony-based methods proved useful for unveiling an emergent property in recreational fisheries that is beneficial for effective cross-scale management. It may not be appropriate to extrapolate information and apply uniform management actions among local waterbodies because angler behaviour was not synchronous at small scales. Rather, anglers respond uniquely to waterbody diversity and therefore substitute waterbodies may be dispersed throughout the landscape. Creating boat access, for example could yield unintended consequences for a particular angler group and cause local and regional shifts in angler behaviour. Evaluating appropriate management options will require a cross-scale monitoring approach that captures angler heterogeneity and waterbody diversity at multiple scales.",,,,,"Chizinski, Christopher/G-6306-2011; Kaemingk, Mark/Q-2191-2019; Pope, Kevin/D-8096-2011","Kaemingk, Mark/0000-0001-9588-4563; Pope, Kevin/0000-0003-1876-1687; Chizinski, Christopher/0000-0001-9294-2588",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,NOV,2018,55,6,,,,,2986,2996,,10.1111/1365-2664.13164,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13164,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000447296300043,View Full Record in Web of Science

LeAnn; Zuckerberg, Benjamin",,,Environmental conditions synchronize waterbird mortality events in the Great Lakes,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Since the 1960s, periodic outbreaks of avian botulism type E have contributed to large-scale die-offs of thousands of waterbirds throughout the Great Lakes of the United States. In recent years, these events have become more common and widespread. Occurring during the summer and autumn months, the prevalence of these die-offs varies across years and is often associated with years of warmer lake temperatures and lower water levels. Little information exists on how environmental conditions mediate the spatial and temporal characteristics of mortality events. 2. In 2010, a citizen science programme, Avian Monitoring for Botulism Lakeshore Events (AMBLE), was launched to enhance surveillance efforts and detect the appearance of beached waterbird carcasses associated with avian botulism type E outbreaks in northern Lake Michigan. Using these data, our goal was to quantify the within-year characteristics of mortality events for multiple species, and to test whether the synchrony of these events corresponded to fluctuations in two environmental factors suspected to be important in the spread of avian botulism: water temperature and the prevalence of green macroalgae. 3. During two separate events of mass waterbird mortality, we found that the detection of bird carcasses was spatially synchronized at scales of c. 40 km. Notably, the extent of this spatial synchrony in avian mortality matched that of fluctuations in lake surface water temperatures and the prevalence of green macroalgae. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings are suggestive of a synchronizing effect where warmer lake temperatures and the appearance of macroalgae mediate the characteristics of avian mortality. In future years, rising lake temperatures and a higher propensity of algal masses could lead to increases in the magnitude and synchronization of avian mortality due to botulism. We advocate that citizen-based monitoring efforts are critical for identifying the potential environmental conditions associated with widespread mortality events and estimating future risk to waterbird populations.",,,,,"Zuckerberg, Benjamin/AAL-9623-2021; Prince, Karine/T-4491-2017","Chipault, Jennifer/0000-0002-1368-622X; Prince, Karine/0000-0001-7739-7438",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,MAY,2018,55,3,,,,,1327,1338,,10.1111/1365-2664.13063,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13063,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000430059500027,View Full Record in Web of Science

Knowledge of the causes of this behavior underlies the ability to manage species, protect the health of humans and the environment, and increase agricultural sustainability. We used an agroecosystem to test Moran's theorem-spatial synchrony results from environmental entrainment. The controlled conditions of the agroecosystem allowed us to create a highly correlated environment while negating the effects of the alternative hypotheses: dispersal and trophic interactions. Under such conditions, synchrony of fruit production by 4288 trees was high over six years in a 32.5 ha pistachio orchard and occurred at similar temporal frequency as weather patterns demonstrating the Moran effect. The spatial synchrony of fruit production was less than the presumed synchrony of the environment supporting research from microcosms and observational studies showing the Moran effect is degraded by local mechanisms. Indeed even under the homogeneous environment of this system, synchrony declined significantly with distance among trees. We present evidence suggesting that the correlation of the local environment affects intrinsic dynamics to cause these patterns. Our findings demonstrate that the Moran effect is, at minimum, partially responsible for the synchronous fruit production in this system.

This pattern may be driven by spatially correlated environmental variation (i.e., Moran effect), dispersal and trophic interactions. Investigating geographic patterns of synchrony can help disentangle the relative importance of these drivers. Using fish abundance data from long-term ecological research (17 years) in the Upper Parana River floodplain, we studied the relative roles of dispersal distance, density dependence differences, and environmental synchrony in determining spatial synchrony of the most common species in this floodplain. We also investigated the geography of spatial synchrony by estimating modularity and site-level contributions to synchrony and anti-synchrony networks. We found positive spatial synchrony for most species, but levels were relatively low. For most species, our explanatory matrices were poorly related to spatial synchrony. We detected modular structures in some species networks, which reflected complex spatial patterns in synchrony. We also detected sites with high importance to spatial synchrony patterns that could be managed to increase metapopulation stability. The variable levels of spatial synchrony for fish species in the Upper Parana River floodplain implies the need to monitor several sites to understand their dynamics in this region. Also, some migratory species of high importance to regional fisheries, such as Prochilodus lineatus, may deserve special monitoring attention due to the increased regional extinction risk associated with their high levels of spatial synchrony.

Using time series of timber damage caused by Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) (southern pine beetle) in 10 states within the southern United States, this study examines synchrony in D. frontalis abundance, the synchronizing effects of temperature extremes, and the evidence for shared cycles among state populations. Cross-correlation and cluster analyses are used to quantify synchrony across a range of geographic distances and to identify groups of states with synchronous dynamics. Similar techniques are used to quantify spatial synchrony in temperature extremes and to examine their relationship to D. frontalis fluctuations. Cross-wavelet analysis is then used to examine pairs of time series for shared cycles. These analyses suggest there is substantial synchrony among states in D. frontalis fluctuations, and there are regional groups of states with similar dynamics. Synchrony in D. frontalis fluctuations also appears related to spatial synchrony in summer and winter temperature extremes. The cross-wavelet results suggest that D. frontalis dynamics may differ among regions and are not stationary. Significant oscillations were present in some states over certain time intervals, suggesting an endogenous feedback mechanism. Management of D. frontalis outbreaks could potentially benefit from a multistate regional approach because populations are synchronous on this level.

Nevertheless, when analyzing only the channels, spatial synchrony was observed to Centropyxis ecornis. Mantel tests showed that the synchrony level, as identified by Spearman and Pearson correlations, was not correlated to geographic distance between environments.

We show that timescale-specific environmental effects, by synchronising local population dynamics on certain timescales only, cause major population cycles over large areas in white-tailed deer. An important aspect of the new mechanism is specificity of synchronising effects to certain timescales, which causes local dynamics to sum across space to a substantial cycle on those timescales.

We hypothesised large flow events occurring during the core egg, and larval period would be negatively associated with recruitment strength and that recruitment patterns across populations would fluctuate in synchrony in response to extremes in river discharge resulting from regional-scale climatic patterns. Discharge during the core egg and larval period, which was highly correlated across the region, and a local-scale variable, spawning stock abundance, were the covariates most important in explaining recruitment strength. We also observed synchronised patterns in recruitment across our populations, thus conforming to predictions of the Moran effect (environmental synchrony). The findings suggest that most remnant populations of Macquarie perch, which are now predominantly isolated within small tributary systems characterised by highly variable flows, face a heightened risk of poor recruitment periods, particularly under climate change predictions.

We discuss the added value of large-scale and long-term population studies, but also emphasize the need to integrate more targeted experimental studies in the context of long-term observational studies. For instance, in the case of the Glanville fritillary project, the long-term study has produced an opportunity to sample individuals for experiments from local populations with a known demographic history. These studies have demonstrated striking differences in dispersal rate and other life-history traits of individuals from newly established local populations (the offspring of colonizers) versus individuals from old, established local populations.

We examined 56 years of data representing chlorophyll density in 26 areas in British seas monitored by the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey. We used wavelet methods to disaggregate synchronous fluctuations by timescale and determine that drivers of synchrony include both biotic and abiotic variables. We tested these drivers for statistical significance by comparison with spatially synchronous surrogate data. Identification of causes of synchrony is distinct from, and goes beyond, determining drivers of local population dynamics. We generated timescale-specific models, accounting for 61% of long-timescale (> 4yrs) synchrony in a chlorophyll density index, but only 3% of observed short-timescale (< 4yrs) synchrony. Thus synchrony and its causes are timescale-specific. The dominant source of long-timescale chlorophyll synchrony was closely related to sea surface temperature, through a climatic Moran effect, though likely via complex oceanographic mechanisms. The top-down action of Calanus finmarchicus predation enhances this environmental synchronising mechanism and interacts with it non-additively to produce more long-timescale synchrony than top-down and climatic drivers would produce independently. Our principal result is therefore a demonstration of interaction effects between Moran drivers of synchrony, a new mechanism for synchrony that may influence many ecosystems at large spatial scales. Author summary The size of the annual bloom in phytoplankton can vary similarly from year to year in different parts of the same oceanic region, a phenomenon called spatial synchrony. The growth of phytoplankton near the ocean surface is the foundation of marine food webs, which include numerous commercially exploited species. And spatial synchrony in phytoplankton abundance time series can have consequences for the total production of marine ecosystems. Therefore we studied the spatial synchrony of fluctuations in green phytoplankton abundance in 26 areas in seas around the British Isles. Variation and synchrony can occur differently on long and short timescales. We used a novel wavelet-based approach to examine long- and short-timescale fluctuations separately, and we thereby show that slow synchronous fluctuations in phytoplankton can be explained by the effects of slow synchronous fluctuations in sea surface temperature and related oceanographic phenomena, and by the effects of synchronous fluctuations in a zooplankton predator. Crucially, these drivers reinforce one another in a super-additive way, the interaction constituting a new mechanism of synchrony. Future changes in the climate or changes in predation are likely to influence phytoplankton synchrony via this mechanism and hence may influence the aggregate productivity of British seas.",,,,,"Sheppard, Lawrence/KFB-7678-2024","Reid, Philip/0000-0001-7728-6746; Sheppard, Lawrence/0000-0002-9032-2059",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,MAR,2019,15,3,,,,,,,e1006744,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006744,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006744,,,,,,,,30921328,,,,,WOS:000463877900020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, spawning was triggered by a short-term (2-day) increase in water temperature and was observed under stable flow conditions (i.e. a lack of precipitation). This study showed that spawning periodicity of bluehead chub and yellowfin shiner tracked daily variation in in-stream conditions, indicating that their reproduction might be affected by anthropogenic disturbances that affect the rate of change in thermal and flow regimes at the fine temporal scale (e.g. hydroelectric dams and impervious cover).",,,,,,"Kim, Seoghyun/0000-0003-3273-0596",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-6691,1600-0633,,,,APR,2020,29,2,,,,,299,310,,10.1111/eff.12515,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12515,,NOV 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000495994900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Studies of synchrony between different environmental variables within marine ecosystems worldwide have highlighted the extent of system responses to exogenous large-scale forcing. However, these spatial connections remain largely unstudied in marine systems, particularly complex coastlines, where a paucity of field observations precludes the analysis of time series. Here, we used time-frequency analyses based on wavelet and wavelet coherence (WC) analysis to quantify the synchrony (co-variations) between environmental time series derived from MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) in the topographically complex inner sea of Chiloe (ISC, 41-44 degrees S) for the 2003-2022 period. We find that the strength of the synchrony between chlorophyll a (Chla) and turbid river plumes (for which we use remote sensing reflectance at 645 nm, Rrs(645)) varies between the northern and southern areas of the ISC; higher synchrony, measured as the WC between these variables, is observed along the northern basin where water and particle exchanges with the Pacific Ocean are reduced. The WC analysis showed higher synchrony between these variables, with dominant periodicities of 0.5 and 1 year resulting from the hydrological regime of the freshwater input in the area that persisted throughout the 2004-2018 period. Our results suggest that the strong and significant spatial synchrony at the regional scale is likely related to the phases of large-scale climatic oscillations, as inferred through the partial wavelet coherence analysis.

Although the causal factors are well known for many synchronized phenomena, several processes concurrently have an impact on spatial synchrony of species, making their separate effects and interactions difficult to quantify. Here we develop a general stochastic model of predator-prey spatial dynamics to predict the outcome of a laboratory microcosm experiment testing for interactions among all known synchronizing factors: ( 1) dispersal of individuals between populations; ( 2) spatially synchronous fluctuations in exogenous environmental factors ( the Moran effect); and ( 3) interactions with other species ( for example, predators) that are themselves spatially synchronized. The Moran effect synchronized populations of the ciliate protist Tetrahymena pyriformis; however, dispersal only synchronized prey populations in the presence of the predator Euplotes patella. Both model and data indicate that synchrony depends on cyclic dynamics generated by the predator. Dispersal, but not the Moran effect, 'phase-locks' cycles, which otherwise become 'decoherent' and drift out of phase. In the absence of cycles, phase-locking is not possible and the synchronizing effect of dispersal is negligible. Interspecific interactions determine population synchrony, not by providing an additional source of synchronized fluctuations, but by altering population dynamics and thereby enhancing the action of dispersal. Our results are robust to wide variation in model parameters representative of many natural predator-prey or host-pathogen systems. This explains why cyclic systems provide many of the most dramatic examples of spatial synchrony in nature.",,,,,"Vasseur, David/A-2545-2013","Vasseur, David/0000-0003-1706-9613",,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-0836,,,,,AUG 20,2009,460,7258,,,,,1007,U90,,10.1038/nature08208,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08208,,,,,,,,19626006,,,,,WOS:000269085500033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate variability and predation may affect recruitment rates, and when these factors are spatially correlated, recruitment rates in spatially separated populations of a species may be synchronized. We used production data from an extensive survey of Willow Ptarmigan from 2000 to 2011 to investigate spatial synchrony in recruitment of juveniles within and among mountain region populations. In addition, we assessed the effects of predation and large-as well as local-scale climate on recruitment of juveniles. Recruitment was synchronized both within and among mountain regions, but the mean spatial correlation was strongest among mountain regions. This may be caused by small-scale factors such as predation or habitat structure, or be a result of sampling variation, which may be large at small spatial scales. The strong synchrony suggests that populations are subject to similar environmental forces. We used mixed effect models at the survey area and mountain region scales to assess the effect of rodent abundance (a proxy for predation rates) and local and regional climate during the breeding season on the recruitment of juvenile birds. Model selection based on AICc revealed that the most parsimonious models at both spatial scales included positive effects of rodent abundance and the North Atlantic oscillation during May, June and July (NAO(MJJ)). The NAO(MJJ) index was positively related to temperature and precipitation during the pre-incubation period; temperature during the incubation period and positive NAO(MJJ) values accelerate plant growth. A comparison of the relative effects of NAO(MJJ) and rodent abundance showed that variation in NAO(MJJ) had greatest impact on the recruitment of juveniles. This suggests that the climate effect was stronger than the effect of rodent abundance in our study populations. This is in contrast to previous studies on Willow Ptarmigan, but may be explained by the collapse in rodent cycles since the 1990s. If Willow Ptarmigan dynamics in the past were linked to the rodent cycle through a shared predator regime, this link may have been weakened when rodent cycles became more irregular, resulting in a more pronounced effect of environmental perturbation on the dynamics of ptarmigan.",,,,,"Nilsen, Erlend B./G-3134-2017","Nilsen, Erlend B./0000-0002-5119-8331; Kvasnes, Mikkel Andreas Jornson/0000-0002-6603-337X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2193-7192,2193-7206,,,,OCT,2014,155,4,,,,,891,903,,10.1007/s10336-014-1072-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-014-1072-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000342412200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the degree of match between host plant and larval phenology is crucial for the growth and survival of many spring-feeding pest insects, suggesting that a phenological match/mismatch-driven Moran effect may act as a synchronizing agent. We analyse the phase-dependent spatial dynamics of defoliation caused by cyclically outbreaking geometrid moths in northern boreal birch forest in Fennoscandia through the most recent massive outbreak (2000-2008). We use satellite-derived time series of the prevalence of moth defoliation and the onset of the growing season for the entire region to investigate the link between the patterns of defoliation and outbreak spread. In addition, we examine whether a phase-dependent coherence in the pattern of spatial synchrony exists between defoliation and onset of the growing season, in order to evaluate if the degree of matching phenology between the moth and their host plant could be the mechanism behind a Moran effect. The strength of regional spatial synchrony in defoliation and the pattern of defoliation spread were both highly phase-dependent. The incipient phase of the outbreak was characterized by high regional synchrony in defoliation and long spread distances, compared with the epidemic and crash phase. Defoliation spread was best described using a two-scale stratified spread model, suggesting that defoliation spread is governed by two processes operating at different spatial scale. The pattern of phase-dependent spatial synchrony was coherent in both defoliation and onset of the growing season. This suggests that the timing of spring phenology plays a role in the large-scale synchronization of birch forest moth outbreaks.",,,,,"Hagen, Snorre B./O-5220-2015","Hagen, Snorre B./0000-0001-8289-7752; Jepsen, Jane Uhd/0000-0003-1517-1569",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,DEC 7,2009,276,1676,,,,,4119,4128,,10.1098/rspb.2009.1148,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2009.1148,,,,,,,,19740876,,,,,WOS:000271055400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we tested whether changing climate patterns could increase voltinism and emergence synchrony in Stenotus rubrovittatus and drive the mirid bug's expansion into currently uninhabited areas of Japan. This expansion could have potentially serious economic consequences for the rice industry. We modelled development of S. rubrovittatus in the field applying the effective accumulated temperature model to calculate the theoretical number of generations and the egg hatching dates from 2003 to 2012 based on a high-resolution, daily weather database. We then performed a regional analysis to assess the relationship between population dynamics and range expansion across the study region and also included a local analysis to evaluate how population parameters affect the presence of S. rubrovittatus at local sites in each year. Results showed that distribution expanded with a relative increase in voltinism and with synchrony of egg hatching date. Moreover, we showed that increased voltinism in the previous year positively influenced local population occurrence. This positive effect suggests that the species' distribution range expands through increased reproduction at both the regional and local scale.

Recent studies showed that synchrony among lower-level components is key to scaling temporal stability across two hierarchical levels, whether spatial or organizational. But an extended framework that integrates both spatial scale and organizational level simultaneously is required to clarify the sources of ecosystem stability at large scales. However, such an extension is far from trivial when taking into account the spatial heterogeneities in real-world ecosystems. In this paper, we develop a partitioning framework that bridges variability and synchrony measures across spatial scales and organizational levels in heterogeneous metacommunities. In this framework, metacommunity variability is expressed as the product of local-scale population variability and two synchrony indices that capture the temporal coherence across species and space, respectively. We develop an R function 'var.partition' and apply it to five types of desert plant communities to illustrate our framework and test how diversity shapes synchrony and variability at different hierarchical levels. As the observation scale increased from local populations to metacommunities, the temporal variability of plant productivity was reduced mainly by factors that decreased species synchrony. Species synchrony decreased from local to regional scales, and spatial synchrony decreased from species to community levels. Local and regional species diversity were key factors that reduced species synchrony at the two scales. Moreover, beta diversity contributed to decreasing spatial synchrony among communities. We conclude that our new framework offers a valuable toolbox for future empirical studies to disentangle the mechanisms and pathways by which ecological factors influence stability at large scales.",,,,,"Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012; HALLETT, LAUREN/R-1560-2017; Lamy, Thomas/K-9430-2015","HALLETT, LAUREN/0000-0002-0718-0257; Lamy, Thomas/0000-0002-7881-0578; Wang, Shaopeng/0000-0002-9430-8879",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,JUN,2019,42,6,,,,,1200,1211,,10.1111/ecog.04290,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04290,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000472122200011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Coupled patch models, based on a within-patch Ronsenzweig-MacArthur Model, are adopted to investigate the impact of predator pursuit (PP) and prey evasion (PE) on the spatial synchrony and pattern formation in metapopulation framework. PP indicates that predators migrate not only from patches of higher predator density to those of lower predator density but also from patches of lower prey density to those of higher prey density; while, PE describes that prey migrate not only from patches of higher prey density to those of lower prey density but also from patches of higher predator density to those of lower predator density. Results show that either PP or PE can reduce spatial synchrony and result in the improvement of metapopulation persistence. Spatially explicit predator-prey system with local migration but without PP and PE can produce self-organized spatial patterns such as circular waves. The effect of PP and PE on spatial predator-prey system can decrease the spatial synchrony and change the circular waves to spatial chaos; therefore, these factors increase the spatial complexity and improve the metapopulation persistence.

In this study we used historical spatially referenced data on gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) outbreaks to document that density-dependent processes can vary substantially across geographical landscapes. This variation may be due in part to geographical variation in habitat (e.g., variation in forest composition). We then used a second-order log-linear stochastic model to explore how inter-population variation in density-dependent processes affects synchronization via either synchronous stochastic forcing or dispersal. We found that geographical variation in direct density-dependence (first order) greatly diminishes synchrony caused by stochasticity but only slightly decreases synchronization via dispersal. Variation in delayed density-dependence (second order) diluted synchrony caused by regional stochasticity to a lesser extent than first-order variation, but it did not have any influence on synchrony caused by dispersal. In general, synchronization caused by dispersal was primarily dependent upon the instability of populations and only weakly, if at all, affected by similarities in density-dependence among populations.

Temporal variability in aggregate properties, like total biomass or abundance, is typically lower in communities with higher species diversity (i.e., the diversity-stability relationship [DSR]). At broader spatial extents, regional-scale aggregate variability is also lower with higher regional diversity (in plant systems) and with lower spatial synchrony. However, focusing exclusively on aggregate properties of communities may overlook potentially destabilizing compositional shifts. It is not yet clear how diversity is related to different components of variability across spatial scales, nor whether regional DSRs emerge across a broad range of organisms and ecosystem types. To test these questions, we compiled a large collection of long-term metacommunity data spanning a wide range of taxonomic groups (e.g., birds, fish, plants, invertebrates) and ecosystem types (e.g., deserts, forests, oceans). We applied a newly developed quantitative framework for jointly analyzing aggregate and compositional variability across scales. We quantified DSRs for composition and aggregate variability in local communities and metacommunities. At the local scale, more diverse communities were less variable, but this effect was stronger for aggregate than compositional properties. We found no stabilizing effect of gamma -diversity on metacommunity variability, but beta -diversity played a strong role in reducing compositional spatial synchrony, which reduced regional variability. Spatial synchrony differed among taxa, suggesting differences in stabilization by spatial processes. However, metacommunity variability was more strongly driven by local variability than by spatial synchrony.

Within the range of the gypsy moth in North America, however, there is considerable geographic heterogeneity in strength of periodicity and the frequency of outbreaks. Furthermore, gypsy moth outbreaks exhibit two significant periodicities: a dominant period of 8-10 years and a subdominant period of 4-5 years. In this study, we used a simulation model and spatially referenced time series of outbreak intensity data from the Northeastern United States to show that the bimodal periodicity in the intensity of gypsy moth outbreaks is largely a result of harmonic oscillations in gypsy moth abundance at and above a 4 km(2) scale of resolution. We also used geographically weighted regression models to explore the effects of gypsy moth host-tree abundance on the periodicity of gypsy moths. We found that the strength of 5-year cycles increased relative to the strength of 10-year cycles with increasing host tree abundance.

In terms of other characteristics that can be measured in ecosystems, such as biomass and nutrient content, intrinsic and extrinsic processes have also been used to explain synchronic variation patterns. Synchrony may clarify whether regional processes are more important than local processes. This study used epiphytic biomass data (chlorophyll-a) collected from eight locations in a floodplain over 11 years. The goal was to estimate epiphytic biomass synchrony. We anticipated that high synchrony levels would be consistent with the strong impact of floods, which affect different floodplain habitats simultaneously. This is equivalent to the Moran effect. In contrast, low synchrony levels would be consistent with the hypothesis that the high environmental heterogeneity of floodplains hampers synchrony. Our results indicated low synchrony, and its variation was not correlated with geographic or environmental distances nor with environmental synchrony. Also, regression models demonstrated low predictive power of local environmental variables in predicting biomass variation in the different sites.

However, the time-series data on which these inferences have been established are relatively short and originate from a specific time period (mostly around 1970-90). Hence, it can be questioned whether the geographical population dynamics patterns are consistent over time (i.e. whether they are stationary). Here we analyse an almost century long (1880-1976) panel of fox bounty time series including 18 counties of Norway, thus spanning the whole range of latitudes of Fennoscandia (i.e. 15 latitudinal degrees). These fox time series mirror the dynamics of their dominant small rodent prey, in particular, with respect to cycle period length and spatial synchrony. While we found some evidence consistent with previous analyses showing a clearly patterned dynamics according to latitude, such patterns were not stationary on a longer time-scale. In particular, we observed a shift from an extensively synchronous (i.e. regionalized) 4-year cycle north of 60 degrees N just after the 'Little Ice Age' (1880-1910) to a diversification of cycle period length (3-5 years) and eventually, partial loss of cyclicity and synchronicity in later periods. Incidents of loss of cyclicity appeared to be preceded by changes in cycle period (i.e. period lengthening and shortening). These results show that the dynamics of Fennoscandian small rodents, and their associated guild of predators, are more prone to change than previously acknowledged.",,,,,"Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014","Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Henden, John-Andre/0000-0002-8825-1167",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,MAY,2009,78,3,,,,,636,645,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01510.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01510.x,,,,,,,,19040680,,,,,WOS:000264784900018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several techniques have been used to describe patterns of spatial synchrony, from correlation coefficients to spectral methods. Some studies have used temporally extensive data sets to identify causes of synchrony. This study instead uses the exceptional spatial extent provided by remotely sensed data to describe, for the first time as far as we know, geographical patterns of synchrony in marine phytoplankton. We use these patterns to illuminate drivers of synchrony and of its geography. Location: The oceans. Time period: 2003-2015. Major taxon: Chlorophyll a-containing phytoplankton. Methods: Synchrony in chlorophyll a concentrations is mapped globally. Spatial statistics and model selection are used to illuminate main statistical determinants of synchrony and of geographical patterns in synchrony. Results: The first main result is that there is a pronounced and previously unmapped geography of synchrony for phytoplankton. For instance, synchrony was highest in the open ocean, specifically in gyres, and lowest in coastal regions. Spatial modelling provided the second main result that synchrony in sea surface temperature (SST) was a major statistical determinant of chlorophyll synchrony in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, indicating a strong Moran effect, although possibly an indirect and/or complex one. In the Pacific Ocean, this effect depended on the time-scales on which synchrony was assessed, providing our third result, which is that synchrony of phytoplankton and its geography can be time-scale specific. Synchrony of surface solar irradiance was not associated with synchrony of chlorophyll. Main conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to map geography of synchrony in marine plankton. We showed that this geography is pronounced. Geographical patterns illuminated determinants of synchrony.

Juvenile body mass in both species was related to temperature and precipitation during several periods of the year. Temperature had the strongest explanatory power in both species, with a similar effect across all populations. There was higher spatial synchrony in temperature compared to precipitation, and accordingly temperature had the strongest synchronizing effect on juvenile body mass. Moreover, periods with strong explanatory power had stronger synchronizing effect on juvenile body mass in both species. However, weather variables with large variation in the effects on body mass among populations had weak synchronizing effect.

In particular, spatial synchrony in amphibian populations remains little studied. We used data from a comprehensive three year study of natterjack toad Bufo calamita populations breeding at 36 ponds to assess whether there was spatial synchrony in the toad breeding activity (start and length of breeding season, total number of egg strings) and reproductive success (premetamorphic survival and production of metamorphs). We defined a novel approach to assess the importance of short-term synchrony at both local and regional scales. The approach employs similarity indices and quantifies the interaction between the temporal and spatial components of populations using mixed effects models. There was no synchrony in the toad breeding activity and reproductive success at the local scale, suggesting that populations function as individual clusters independent of each other. Regional synchrony was apparent in the commencement and duration of the breeding season and in the number of egg strings laid (indicative of female population size). Regional synchrony in both rainfall and temperature are likely to explain the patterns observed (e.g. Moran effect). There was no evidence supporting regional synchrony in reproductive success, most likely due to spatial variability in the environmental conditions at the breeding ponds, and to differences in local population fitness (e.g. fecundity). The small scale asynchronous dynamics and regional synchronous dynamics in the number of breeding females indicate that it is best to monitor several populations within a subset of regions. Importantly, variations in the toad breeding activity and reproductive success are not synchronous, and it is thus important to consider them both when assessing the conservation status of pond-breeding amphibians.",,,,,"Emmerson, Mark/ABD-6274-2021","Emmerson, Mark/0000-0003-1034-8572",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,AUG,2012,35,8,,,,,749,759,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.06912.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.06912.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000305892300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the most common approaches is to quantify the variation through time in community or ecosystem aggregate attributes (e.g. total biomass), referred to as aggregate variability. It is now widely recognized that aggregate variability represents only one aspect of communities and ecosystems, and compositional variability, the changes in the relative frequency of species in an assemblage, is equally important. Recent contributions have also begun to explore ecological stability at regional spatial scales, where interconnected local communities form metacommunities, a key concept in managing complex landscapes. However, the conceptual frameworks and measures of ecological stability in space have only focused on aggregate variability, leaving a conceptual gap. Here, we address this gap with a novel framework for quantifying the aggregate and compositional variability of communities and ecosystems through space and time. We demonstrate that the compositional variability of a metacommunity depends on the degree of spatial synchrony in compositional trajectories among local communities. We then provide a conceptual framework in which compositional variability of 1) the metacommunity through time and 2) among local communities combine into four archetype scenarios: spatial stasis (low/low), spatial synchrony (high/low), spatial asynchrony (high/high) and spatial compensation (low/high). We illustrate this framework based on numerical examples and a case study of a macroalgal metacommunity in which low spatial synchrony reduced variability in aggregate biomass at the metacommunity scale, while masking high spatial synchrony in compositional trajectories among local communities. Finally, we discuss the role of dispersal, environmental heterogeneity, species interactions and suggest future avenues. We believe this framework will be helpful for considering both aspects of variability simultaneously, which is important to better understand ecological stability in natural and complex landscapes in response to environmental changes.",,,,,"Castorani, Max/LDE-5681-2024; Sokol, Eric/HZL-4014-2023; Record, Sydne/JTS-8794-2023; Zarnetske, Phoebe/V-3974-2019; Tonkin, Jonathan/J-4120-2013; Swan, Christopher/ITW-1070-2023; Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012; Lamy, Thomas/K-9430-2015; Wisnoski, Nathan/AAE-2174-2019","Compagnoni, Aldo/0000-0001-8302-7492; Lamy, Thomas/0000-0002-7881-0578; Castorani, Max/0000-0002-7372-9359; Wisnoski, Nathan/0000-0002-2929-5231; Sokol, Eric/0000-0001-5923-0917; Wang, Shaopeng/0000-0002-9430-8879",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,DEC,2021,130,12,,,,,2078,2092,,10.1111/oik.08517,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.08517,,SEP 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000697656900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drought is a natural disturbance that can cause widespread mortality of aquatic organisms in wetlands. We hypothesized that seasonal drying of marsh surfaces (i.e. hydrological disturbance) shapes spatio-temporal patterns of fish populations. 2. We tested whether population dynamics of fishes were synchronized by hydrological disturbance (Moran effect) or distance separating study sites (dispersal). Spatio-temporal patterns were examined in local populations of five abundant species at 17 sites (sampled five times per year from 1996 to 2001) in a large oligotrophic wetland. 3. Fish densities differed significantly across spatio-temporal scales for all species. For all species except eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a significant portion of spatio-temporal variation in density was attributed to drying events (used as a covariate). 4. We observed three patterns of response to hydrological disturbance. Densities of bluefin killifish (Lucania goodei), least killifish (Heterandria formosa), and golden topminnow (Fundulus chrysotus) were usually lowest after a dry down and recovered slowly. Eastern mosquitofish showed no distinct response to marsh drying (i.e. they recovered quickly). Flagfish (Jordanella floridae) density was often highest after a dry down and then declined. Population growth after a dry down was often asymptotic for bluefin killifish and golden topminnow, with greatest asymptotic density and longest time to recovery at sites that dried infrequently. 5. Fish population dynamics were synchronized by hydrological disturbance (independent of distance) and distance separating study sites (independent of hydrological disturbance). Our ability to separate the relative importance of the Moran effect from dispersal was strengthened by a weak association between hydrological synchrony and distance among study sites. Dispersal was the primary mechanism for synchronous population dynamics of flagfish, whereas hydrological disturbance was the primary mechanism for synchronous population dynamics of the other species examined. 6.

However, the effects of the spatial and temporal structure of environmental fluctuations on host-parasite dynamics are not well understood. Temporal fluctuations can be random but positively autocorrelated, such that the environment is similar to the recent past (red noise), or random and uncorrelated with the past (white noise). We imposed red or white temporal temperature fluctuations on experimental metapopulations of Paramecium caudatum, experiencing an epidemic of the bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. Metapopulations (two subpopulations linked by migration) experienced fluctuations between stressful (5 degrees C) and permissive (23 degrees C) conditions following red or white temporal sequences. Spatial variation in temperature fluctuations was implemented by exposing subpopulations to the same (synchronous temperatures) or different (asynchronous temperatures) temporal sequences. Red noise, compared with white noise, enhanced parasite persistence. Despite this, red noise coupled with asynchronous temperatures allowed infected host populations to maintain sizes equivalent to uninfected populations. It is likely that this occurs because subpopulations in permissive conditions rescue declining subpopulations in stressful conditions. We show how patterns of temporal and spatial environmental fluctuations can impact parasite spread and host population abundance.

Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain masting. Variations in seed crop may result from stochastic climate factors (temperature, rainfall, etc.), and/or masting may be a plant evolutionary strategy to avoid specific seed predators. To determine the effect of climate on the annual pattern of cone production in the European larch (Larix decidua), we analyzed larch cone production from 1975 to 2005 at 20 sites in the French Alps, ranging from 1,300 to 2,100 m a.s.l.

We examined the effects of mast seeding on the predation of larch cones by the dominant specific pre-dispersal seed predators, cone fly Strobilomyia spp. Larch cone production varied across the years and was spatially synchronized throughout the region. We constructed two models to explain seed production, one for sites at low (< 1,800 m) and one for sites at high (a parts per thousand yen1,800 m) altitudes, using partial least squares (PLS) regressions to detect across a large number of climate indices (306) the factors which best explain cone production. Monthly indices were more accurate descriptors than 4-month period indices. The predation rate was lower in high cone production years that followed low production years, supporting the predator satiation hypothesis. However, variable cone production explained only a small part of predation rates (45 and 25% at low and high altitudes, respectively). Predation was also directly affected by climate conditions.

In particular, the degree of synchrony in metapopulation dynamics determines how resilient a metapopulation is to a widespread disturbance. In this study, we used 21 years of egg mass count data across 64 nonpermanent freshwater ponds in Connecticut, USA to evaluate patterns of abundance and growth and to assess regional as well as local factors in shaping the population dynamics of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica = Lithobates sylvaticus). In particular, we asked whether a species known to undergo metapopulation dynamics exhibited spatial synchrony in abundances. With the exception of a single year when breeding took place during severe drought conditions, our analyses revealed no evidence of synchrony despite close proximity (mean minimum distance < 300 m) of breeding ponds across the 3213-ha study area. Instead, local, pond-scale conditions best predicted patterns of abundance and population growth rate. We found negative density dependence on population growth rate within ponds as well as evidence that larger neighboring pond populations had a negative effect on focal ponds. Beyond density, pond depth was a critical predictor; deeper ponds supported larger populations. Drought conditions and warm winters negatively affected populations. Overall, breeding ponds vary in critical ways that either support larger, more persistent populations or smaller populations that are not represented by breeding pairs in some years. The infrequency of spatial synchrony in this system is surprising and suggests greater resilience to stressors than would have been expected if dynamics were strongly synchronized. More generally, understanding the characteristics of systems that determine synchronous population dynamics will be critical to predicting which species are more or less resilient to widespread disturbances like land conversion or climate change.",,,,,"Rowland, Freya/ABE-3009-2021; Urban, Mark/Y-2430-2019; Rodrigues, Susan B./AAD-8519-2022","Skelly, David/0000-0002-5067-4535; Rodrigues, Susan B./0000-0002-9476-3636; Freidenburg, Kealoha/0000-0001-7161-0007; Rowland, Freya/0000-0002-1041-5301; Benard, Michael/0000-0002-8585-3816; Rubinstein, Adriana/0000-0001-5072-7804",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JUL,2022,103,7,,,,,,,e3696,10.1002/ecy.3696,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3696,,APR 2022,,,,,,35352342,,,,,WOS:000795972700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We hypothesized that the combination of increased hardwood relative to host tree species, prevalence of younger forests, and fragmentation of those forests due to forest harvesting legacies would reduce outbreak intensity, increase outbreak frequency, and decrease spatial synchrony in spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana outbreaks. We investigated these hypotheses using tree ring samples collected across 51 sites pooled into 16 subareas distributed across a large ecoregion spanning the international border between Ontario (Canada), and Minnesota (USA). This ecoregion contains contrasting land management zones with clear differences in forest landscape structure (i.e. forest composition and spatial configuration) while minimizing the confounding influence of climate. Cluster analyses of the 76-yr time-series generally grouped by subareas found within the same land management zone. Spatial nonparametric covariance analysis indicated that the highest and lowest degree of spatial synchrony of spruce budworm outbreaks were found within unmanaged wilderness and lands managed at fine spatial scales in Minnesota, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, we also found that forest composition, configuration, and climate together accounted for a total of 40% of the variance in outbreak chronologies, with a high level of shared variance between composition and configuration (13%) and between composition and climate (9%). At the scale of our study, climate on its own did not explain any of the spatial variation in outbreaks. Outbreaks were of higher frequency, lower intensity, and less spatially synchronized in more fragmented, younger forests with a lower proportion of host species, with opposing outbreak characteristics observed in regions characterised by older forests with more concentrated host species.

We hypothesized that variability in survival and fecundity, driven by climate variability at different points in the life cycle, scales up from local populations to drive regional characteristics of population cycling and spatial synchronization. Location Forest in the US Upper Midwest and Great Lakes region. Methods We tested hypotheses linking variation in vital rates of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus), a declining species that displays decadal population cycles, to temperature and precipitation anomalies and land use intensity, using rate estimates from multiple locations in eastern North America. We used climatedemographic linkages to simulate spatially explicit population dynamics from 1982 to 2069, evaluated predictions against monitoring data and assessed predicted population dynamics under future climate projections. Results Nest success and winter survival were linked to temperature and precipitation anomalies, and demographic models explained important spatiotemporal characteristics of cycling and synchrony in monitoring data. The climate-driven vital rates were necessary for cycling and synchrony in models, even though the four included climate variables were not individually periodic. Cycling and synchrony were stronger at more northerly latitudes, but this transition occurred abruptly, reflecting regional variation in winter conditions. Forecasts suggested climate-driven cycling through mid-century, followed by desynchronization and dampening. Main conclusions Climate variability can drive spatio-temporal variation in demographic rates, and population cycling can result from these relationships. Pathways linking climate to broad-scale population dynamics involve responses of vital rates to several climate variables at different times of year and may be more complex than direct responses to known modes of climate variability. The wide-ranging impact of climate change on the demographics of northerly adapted species has the potential to degrade patterns of population synchrony and cycling.",,,,,"Zuckerberg, Benjamin/AAL-9623-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,APR,2017,23,4,,,,,421,434,,10.1111/ddi.12540,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.12540,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000396040700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, precipitation during early summer also influenced the population fluctuations. This suggests that the major influences of climate on ibex population dynamics operated either through loss of individuals during winter or early summer, or through an effect on fecundity.

We use a newly built tree ring network collected from 4,028 trees at 144 forest locations across East Asian subtropical forests (EASF), to assess long-term influences of ENSO on the spatiotemporal variability in tree radial growth across China at subcontinental scales (similar to 2,000 km). Our results demonstrate a west-east dipole pattern of synchronized tree growth in EASF tree populations, with positive growth responses to El Nino in southeastern China, and negative growth responses in southwestern China, likely due to different patterns in moisture limitation.

Species responses to flow alteration are however poorly understood and are thus difficult to predict. Here, we investigated temporal changes in fish community structure (taxonomic and functional) in the Tonle Sap Lake, a floodplain ecosystem in Cambodia that supports the world largest inland fisheries and a UNESCO biosphere reserve. Fish catches were monitored daily at five locations around the lake between 2012 and 2015, with 53 species obtained over the course of the field study. Nine fish traits were recorded and used to characterize the functional composition of fish communities. Temporal changes in functional community structure in response to hydrological variation were assessed using multiple co-inertia analysis (MCOA) and cross-correlation function (CCF) approaches. Analyses revealed an abrupt shift in functional structure following extreme flood events in 2013 that included a marked decrease in large-bodied fish at high trophic levels. Also observed were seasonal changes in the relative abundance of life-history strategies, feeding habits, and accessory respiratory adaptations. Black fish (species that are relatively sedentary with an equilibrium-type life-history strategy) dominated during low-water periods, whereas white fish (migratory species with opportunistic or periodic life-history strategies) were dominant during high-water periods. Dynamics of local assemblage structure were fairly synchronous spatially and were independent of the distance between locations. Species responses to the peak flood pulse were estimated to lag 1-2 months. Findings from this study indicate that management of fisheries resources in the Tonle Sap Lake should consider differential responses of species to hydrology as a function of life-history strategies and other functional traits as well as factors that may influence time lags in population and community changes to extreme flow events.",,,,,"Chea, Ratha/KII-8058-2024; chevalier, mathieu/AAU-6540-2020; Grenouillet, Gael/E-6518-2019","Chea, Ratha/0000-0002-1110-0766; Grenouillet, Gael/0000-0003-3588-3694",,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,DEC,2020,11,12,,,,,,,e03303,10.1002/ecs2.3303,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3303,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000603657600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Analysis of population synchrony and its relationship to distance has played a major role in population ecology but has been absent from most studies of managed populations, such as agricultural arthropods. The extent to which populations at different locations are synchronized reflects the relative roles of shared environmental impacts, such as weather, and localizing processes, such as dispersal. The strength and pattern of synchrony, and the processes generating synchrony, have direct management implications. For the first time, we bring together two major paths of population-ecology research: spatial synchrony of population dynamics, which has been studied across birds, mammals, and insects, and spatial ecology of agricultural arthropod populations. We compare and contrast synchrony of two arthropod species, a spider mite and a leafhopper, across a vineyard region spanning 30-km distances, at within-year (weekly) and between-year time scales. Despite the enormous scope of agriculture, such long-term, large-scale data sets suitable for investigating local and regional dynamics are rare. For both species, synchrony is more strongly localized for annual peak abundance across 11 years than it typically is for weekly dynamics within each year's growing season. This suggests that between-year processes such as overwintering merit greater investigation. Within each year, both localized and region-wide synchrony was found for both species, but leafhoppers showed stronger localization than spider mites, corresponding to their longer generation time and stronger dispersal ability. This demonstrates that the overall herbivore dynamics of the system occur at multiple spatial scales and that the importance of different processes generating synchrony varies by species. The analysis includes new spatiotemporal randomization and bootstrap tests that can be applied to many systems. Our results highlight the value of large-scale, long-term monitoring programs for many kinds of managed populations. They also point toward the potential to test synchrony mechanisms more directly and to synthesize synchrony and landscape analyses.",,,,,"de Valpine, Perry/KBQ-9849-2024","de Valpine, Perry/0000-0002-8329-6796",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,OCT,2010,20,7,,,,,1926,1935,,10.1890/09-0468.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-0468.1,,,,,,,,21049880,,,,,WOS:000282278200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effect is robust, occurring in a wide range of theoretical models exhibiting cyclic or quasi-cyclic population dynamics.

Spatial environmental covariance is one of the principal factors influencing this synchrony on a large scale. However, most studies focus on population abundances, and little evidence exists on the spatial synchrony of demographic parameters. We used a 15-year dataset from two populations of a vulnerable bird species, the Dalmatian Pelican (Pelecanus crispus), to identify local and global environmental factors that cause population synchrony. We show that survival rates were temporally synchronised between the studied populations and that a large part (> 50 % for both populations) of this covariation was driven by local environmental conditions. Several components of the North Atlantic Oscillation index were correlated with local climatic conditions, but not all of these components can be used as informative proxies for future variation in survival. We also present evidence that an individual's future survival can be strongly influenced by the conditions occurring during the early period of its life. Environmental factors such as water level and food availability had similar influences on breeding success and juvenile survival. Juvenile survival was lower during dry years and years of low food availability. This finding indicated that intra-specific competition may act as a limiting factor for species demography, especially in large populations. Estimating the strength of synchrony is important and should be considered in population and metapopulation analyses and in relationship to conservation measures.",,,,,"Theodorou, Konstantinos/L-2881-2013","Theodorou, Konstantinos/0000-0002-9314-1560; Doxa, Aggeliki/0000-0003-4279-1499",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-3896,1438-390X,,,,OCT,2012,54,4,,,,,499,507,,10.1007/s10144-012-0330-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-012-0330-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000309065300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

To elucidate the relative synchronizing effects of environmental perturbations from those of dispersal movements of small mammalian prey or their predators, we investigated the spatial dynamics of Microtus vole populations in two differently structured landscapes which experience similar patterns of weather and climatic conditions. Vole and predator abundances were monitored for three years on 28 agricultural field sites arranged into two 120-km-long transect lines in western Finland. Sites on one transect were interconnected by continuous agricultural farmland (continuous landscape), while sites on the other were isolated from one another to a varying degree by mainly forests (fragmented landscape). Vole populations exhibited large-scale (> 120 km) spatial synchrony in fluctuations, which did not differ in degree between the landscapes or decline with increasing distance between trapping sites. However, spatial variation in vole population growth rates was higher in the fragmented than in the continuous landscape. Although vole-eating predators were more numerous in the continuous agricultural landscape than in the fragmented, our results suggest that predators do not exert a great influence on the degree of spatial synchrony of vole population fluctuations, but they may contribute to bringing out-of-phase prey patches towards a regional density level. The spatial dynamics of vole populations were similar in both fragmented and continuous landscapes despite inter-landscape differences in both predator abundance and possibilities of vole dispersal.

The primary goal of these analyses was to determine whether processes expected in metapopulations, including low spatial synchrony, frequent local disappearances, and colonization leading to population rescue, play important roles in species that are not necessarily subdivided into discrete patches. In general, spatial autocorrelation was less than expected based on environmental factors, with only one-third of species significantly spatially autocorrelated between sites up to 100 km apart and only three (1%) spatially autocorrelated on a continental scale. Spatial autocorrelation was significantly lower for primarily aquatic compared to terrestrial species and tended to be higher among small, widely distributed, and relatively abundant species with more northern winter distributions and low relative population variability. Local disappearances (years when no individuals were detected) were also common and tended to last longer in aquatic, migratory species high in the food chain. When controlling for confounding factors, there was a significant positive relationship between spatial synchrony and the length of disappearances among resident species, as expected if population rescue contributes to interspecific variation in these parameters. These results support the hypothesis that processes expected in metapopulations may be important in many resident bird species. They also provide insight as to which species are more vulnerable to global extinction as well as those for which monitoring efforts aimed at detecting large-scale population declines may be performed efficiently by extrapolating from data acquired at relatively few sites.",,,,,"Koenig, Walter/A-5509-2009","Koenig, Walter/0000-0001-6207-1427",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,SEP,2001,82,9,,,,,2636,2644,,10.2307/2679942,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2679942,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000171049100021,View Full Record in Web of Science

We find that when neighbours are coupled (e.g. by dispersal), noisy intrinsic oscillations become distinguishable from noise-induced oscillations at a transition point related to synchronisation that is distinct from the deterministic bifurcation point.

Of these, dispersal historically has been the least well studied in natural systems, partly because of the difficulty in quantifying dispersal in situ. We hypothesized that dispersal routes of plankton were based on the major and consistent water current movements in Kentucky Lake, a large reservoir in western Kentucky, USA. Then, using 26-year time series collected at 16 locations, we used matrix regression techniques to test whether spatial heterogeneity in strengths of hypothesized dispersal predicted spatial patterns of synchrony of phytoplankton and zooplankton, thereby testing for evidence of dispersal as a possible mechanism of synchrony in this system. Nearly all taxa showed significant spatial synchrony that did not decline with increasing linear distance between locations. All taxa also showed substantial geographic structure in synchrony that was not explained by linear distance. Matrix regression revealed that our hypothesized matrix of dispersal pathways, which differed substantially from linear distance, was a significant predictor of spatial variability in synchrony in phytoplankton biomass, and Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia lumholtzi densities. Thus dispersal was a likely mechanism of synchrony for these taxa. Our hypothesized dispersal matrix was a significant predictor of spatial patterns of synchrony for these taxa even after accounting for numerous alternative possible mechanisms, including possible Moran effects through any of ten physical/abiotic constraints.

The most common explanations have been the Moran effect (synchronous external stochastic influences) and the effect of dispersal among populations. Since ecological systems are typically subject to large spatially varying perturbations which destroy synchrony, a plausible mechanism explaining synchrony must produce rapid convergence to synchrony. We analyze the dynamics through time of the synchronizing effects of dispersal and, consequently, determine whether dispersal can be the mechanism which produces synchrony. Specifically, using methods new to ecology, we analyze a two patch predator-prey model, with identical weak dispersal between the patches. We find that a difference in time scales (i.e. one population has dynamics occurring much faster than the other) between the predator and prey species is the most important requirement for fast convergence to synchrony.

Introducing a small-world dispersal kernel leads to a clear reduction in synchrony with both increasing dispersal rate and small-world dispersal probability across a variety of biological scenarios.

Here, we develop a general theoretical framework to study the stability and variability of ecosystems at multiple scales. Analogously to the partitioning of biodiversity, we propose the concepts of alpha, beta and gamma variability. Gamma variability at regional (metacommunity) scale can be partitioned into local alpha variability and spatial beta variability, either multiplicatively or additively. On average, variability decreases from local to regional scales, which creates a negative variability-area relationship. Our partitioning framework suggests that mechanisms of regional ecosystem stability can be understood by investigating the influence of ecological factors on alpha and beta variability. Diversity can provide insurance effects at the various levels of variability, thus generating alpha, beta and gamma diversity-stability relationships. As a consequence, the loss of biodiversity and habitat impairs ecosystem stability at the regional scale.

When each group of measurements is distributed in space, the exponent b of this power law is conjectured to reflect aggregation in the spatial distribution. TL has had practical application in many areas since its initial demonstrations for the population density of spatially distributed species in population ecology. Another widely observed aspect of populations is spatial synchrony, which is the tendency for time series of population densities measured in different locations to be correlated through time. Recent studies showed that patterns of population synchrony are changing, possibly as a consequence of climate change. We use mathematical, numerical, and empirical approaches to show that synchrony affects the validity and parameters of TL. Greater synchrony typically decreases the exponent b of TL. Synchrony influenced TL in essentially all of our analytic, numerical, randomization-based, and empirical examples.

This concept was first advanced by Patrick Moran who showed, based on several assumptions, that long-term population synchrony will equal the synchrony of environmental stochasticity among locations. We examine the consequences of violating one of Moran's assumptions, namely that environmental synchrony is constant through time. We demonstrate that the synchrony of weather conditions from regions across the United States varied considerably from 1895 to 2010. Using a simulation model modified from Moran's original study, we show that temporal variation in environmental synchrony can cause changes in population synchrony, which in turn can temporarily increase or decrease the amplitude of regional-scale population fluctuations. A case study using the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) provides empirical support for these predictions.

In marine systems, classical theory holds that the influence of demographic processes and dispersal is confined to local populations whereas the environment controls regional patterns of abundance.

We reveal synchronized fluctuations in the abundance of mussel populations across a whole continent despite limited larval dispersal and strong environmental forcing.

Recruitment depends on mean seed production, but also on the interannual variability and among-plant synchrony in seed production, the phenomenon known as mast seeding. Thus, predicting the long-term response of global vegetation dynamics to climate change requires understanding the response of masting to changing climate. Recently, data and methods have become available allowing the first assessments of long-term changes in masting. Reviewing the literature, we evaluate evidence for a fingerprint of climate change on mast seeding and discuss the drivers and impacts of these changes. We divide our discussion into the main characteristics of mast seeding: interannual variation, synchrony, temporal autocorrelation and mast frequency. Data indicate that masting patterns are changing but the direction of that change varies, likely reflecting the diversity of proximate factors underlying masting across taxa. Experiments to understand the proximate mechanisms underlying masting, in combination with the analysis of long-term datasets, will enable us to understand this observed variability in the response of masting. This will allow us to predict future shifts in masting patterns, and consequently ecosystem impacts of climate change via its impacts on masting.

We further show that large-scale climatic patterns (Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and, to a lesser degree, Arctic Oscillation (AO)) are strongly related to the observed MPB synchrony, and that they probably operate through controlling the frequency of extreme cold winter temperatures that affect MPB larvae survival. A smaller portion of the data's variability is linked to the onset of the two largest outbreaks in the studied period and might be attributed to dispersal from outbreak-prone areas or else to differences in microhabitat (e. g., host availability) in these regions. The onset of a warm PDO phase in 1976 favored MPB outbreaks by reducing the occurrence of extremely low winter temperatures province-wide. Likewise, the exceptionally high and persistent AO values of the late 1980s and 1990s enhanced MPB activity in the southern and northern parts of the region.

However, populations do not always respond to broad-scale environmental changes synchronously across a landscape. We combined multiple datasets for a retrospective analysis of time-series count data (5-28 annual samples per segment) at 144 stream segments dispersed over nearly 1,000 linear kilometers of range to characterize the population structure and scale of spatial synchrony across the southern native range of a coldwater stream fish (brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis), which is sensitive to stream temperature and flow variations. Spatial synchrony differed by life stage and geographic region: it was stronger in the juvenile life stage than in the adult life stage and in the northern sub-region than in the southern sub-region. Spatial synchrony of trout populations extended to 100-200 km but was much weaker than that of climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and stream flow. Early life stage abundance changed over time due to annual variation in summer temperature and winter and spring stream flow conditions. Climate effects on abundance differed between sub-regions and among local populations within sub-regions, indicating multiple cross-scale interactions where climate interacted with local habitat to generate only a modest pattern of population synchrony over space. Overall, our analysis showed higher degrees of response heterogeneity of local populations to climate variation and consequently population asynchrony than previously shown based on analysis of individual, geographically restricted datasets. This response heterogeneity indicates that certain local segments characterized by population asynchrony and resistance to climate variation could represent unique populations of this iconic native coldwater fish that warrant targeted conservation. Advancing the conservation of this species can include actions that identify such priority populations and incorporate them into landscape-level conservation planning.

However, the effects of such variability on coexistence and the scale at which it operates are seldom understood. To quantify such effects, we examined spatial and temporal dynamics in the abundance and frequency of alternative phenotypes of male coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch Walbaum, which mature as either large fighters (age-3 'hooknoses') or small sneakers (age-2 'jacks'). Using over 20 years of data on coded-wire tagged fish released from nine Oregon hatcheries, we tested for the effects of ocean environment independent of those due to freshwater rearing. Annual fluctuations of the abundance of jack and hooknose males within populations were correlated strongly by brood year (cohort) but not by return year (breeding group). This occurred independently of significant effects of release practice (i.e. the number of fish released, body size at release and date of release), indicating that a synchronized fluctuation in mortality during the first year at sea was the predominant cause. As a result, the annual frequency of the alternative phenotypes at breeding varied considerably within populations. Spatial patterns in the annual fluctuations of the two phenotypes were similar (i.e. synchronous among populations), except that jacks showed local spatial structure (decreased synchrony with distance) not evident among hooknoses. This suggests that oceanic processes affecting the two phenotypes operate at different spatial scales. Despite effects on salmon abundance, the ocean environment had little influence through its effects on salmon growth on the relative frequencies of the alternative phenotypes within and among populations. The results provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of alternative phenotypes, including an intragenerational time lag that increases annual variability in phenotype frequencies at breeding (return years) and the significance of local freshwater processes, rather than oceanic processes, on phenotype expression. Freshwater processes, such as juvenile growth, timing of migration and breeding competition, operating at evolutionary and intragenerational time-scales, are probably the predominant forces affecting phenotype frequency.",,,,,"Fleming, Ian/I-7217-2012; Koseki, Yusuke/Q-1176-2019","Koseki, Yusuke/0000-0001-9588-3018; Fleming, Ian/0000-0002-5541-824X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,MAR,2006,75,2,,,,,445,455,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01065.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01065.x,,,,,,,,16637997,,,,,WOS:000236384700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Both malarial. types are declining throughout the region, except in the two provinces that share a large border with Myanmar. The rate of decline in P vivax has decreased ross the region since the end of the 1980s, and this may be a signal of developing resistance or changing vector potential.

Synchrony between local populations is believed to be widespread in nature because it has been found across a range of ecological guilds and across large spatial scales. However, a detailed understanding is still lacking of the extent of synchronous patterns in population parameters across animal communities, and of the relative importance of the several potential causes of population synchrony. This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of how widespread spatial synchrony is in bird communities and to identify the main ecological drivers of synchrony. To achieve this we examined patterns of synchrony among bird populations inhabiting two contrasting areas of southeast Australia: the Victoria Central Highlands and Booderee National Park.

We compare predictions of models informed by daily mobility data (reference) with that of models informed by time-averaged mobility data, and mobility model approximations. We find that the gravity model overestimates the spatial synchrony, while the radiation model underestimates the spatial synchrony. Using time-averaged mobility resulted in spatial spreading patterns comparable to the daily mobility model. We fit the model to 2014-2017 influenza data from sentinel hospitals in Bangladesh, using a sequential version of approximate Bayesian computation. We find a good agreement between our estimated model and the case data. We estimate transmissibility and regional spread of influenza in Bangladesh, which are useful for policy planning.

Any assessment of this temporal variability needs long-term quantitative data on abundances. Here we use museum data (1940-2017) of butterflies and burnet moths from southwestern Germany and central Austria comprising 220,758 records from 155 species, and 55,641 records from 170 species, respectively. We ask whether population fluctuations and long-term population trends are spatially synchronized across larger spatial distances (>300 km) according to the Moran effect, and whether common trends in community composition and stability exist? Population fluctuations of 85.5% of species jointly occurring in both study regions were positively correlated (mean r = 0.30 +/- 0.03). Comparing different time windows, we found different sets of species being in spatial synchrony reflecting temporal changes in butterfly community composition. Mesophilic, habitat generalist, and dispersive species were significantly more synchronized than xerothermophilic, habitat specialist, and sedentary species. Long-distance travelers were particularly synchronized. In both study regions, species rank orders became less even with time. Stability in community composition increased with time with an ongoing trend to faunal homogenization, but not to species loss. Our study points to global and not to local drivers behind trends in butterfly population fluctuations and compositional stability, in the present case to altered land use and urbanization as major drivers toward synchrony and homogenization. Finally, our data have implications for conservation strategies as they strongly indicate that natural landscape structures are associated with higher faunal compositional variability in comparison to agricultural and urban landscapes.",,,,,"Ulrich, Werner/A-6582-2013","Schmitt, Thomas/0000-0002-1389-8396",,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,JUL,2023,14,7,,,,,,,e4615,10.1002/ecs2.4615,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4615,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001031027800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Common biological systems of coupled oscillators have been shown to be members of the Ising universality class, meaning that the very simple Ising model replicates certain spatial statistics of these systems at stationarity. This observation is useful because it reveals which aspects of spatial pattern arise independently of the details governing local dynamics, resulting in both deeper understanding of and a simpler baseline model for biological synchrony. However, in many situations a system's dynamics are of greater interest than their static spatial properties. Here, we ask whether a dynamical Ising model can replicate universal and non-universal features of ecological systems, using noisy coupled metapopulation models with two-cycle dynamics as a case study. The standard Ising model makes unrealistic dynamical predictions, but the Ising model with memory corrects this by using an additional parameter to reflect the tendency for local dynamics to maintain their phase of oscillation. By fitting the two parameters of the Ising model with memory to simulated ecological dynamics, we assess the correspondence between the Ising and ecological models in several of their features (location of the critical boundary in parameter space between synchronous and asynchronous dynamics, probability of local phase changes and ability to predict future dynamics). We find that the Ising model with memory is reasonably good at representing these properties of ecological metapopulations.

These factors may affect the dynamics of local populations and of the entire metapopulation differently. Previous studies have shown that dispersal can stabilize local populations; however, as dispersal also tends to increase spatial synchrony, its net effect on metapopulation stability has been controversial. Here we present a simple metapopulation model to study how dispersal, in interaction with other spatial and local processes, affects the temporal variability of metapopulations in a stochastic environment. Our results show that in homogeneous metapopulations, the local stabilizing and spatial synchronizing effects of dispersal cancel each other out, such that dispersal has no effect on metapopulation variability. This result is robust to moderate heterogeneities in local and spatial parameters. When local and spatial dynamics exhibit high heterogeneities, however, dispersal can either stabilize or destabilize metapopulation dynamics through various mechanisms. Our findings have important theoretical and practical implications. We show that dispersal functions as a form of spatial intraspecific mutualism in metapopulation dynamics and that its effect on metapopulation stability is opposite to that of interspecific competition on local community stability. Our results also suggest that conservation corridors should be designed with appreciation of spatial heterogeneities in population dynamics in order to maximize metapopulation stability.",,,,,"Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012","Haegeman, Bart/0000-0003-2325-4727; Wang, Shaopeng/0000-0002-9430-8879",,,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,OCT 1,2015,3,,,,,,,,e1295,10.7717/peerj.1295,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1295,,,,,,,,26557427,,,,,WOS:000364328700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analysed the long term population patterns of the cabbage stem flea beetle Psylliodes chrysocephala in winter oilseed rape over 50 years.3. Psylliodes chrysocephala larval density from 3045 winter oilseed rape fields in southern Sweden showed strong 8 year population cycles in regional mean density. Fluctuations in larval density were synchronous over time across five subregional populations. Subregional mean environmental variables explained 90.6% of the synchrony in P. chrysocephala populations at the 7-11 year time-scale. The number of days below -10 degrees C showed strong anti phase coherence with larval densities in the 7-11 year time-scale, such that more cold days resulted in low larval densities. High levels of the North Atlantic Oscillation weather system are coherent and anti phase with cold weather in Scania, Sweden.4. At the field-scale, later crop planting date and more cold winter days were associated with decreased overwintering larval density. Warmer autumn temperatures, resulting in greater larval accumulated degree days early in the season, increased overwintering larval density.5. Despite variation in environmental conditions and crop management, 8 year cycles persisted for cabbage stem flea beetle throughout the 50 years of data collection. Moran effects, influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation weather patterns, are the primary drivers of this cycle and synchronicity. Insect pest data collected in commercial agriculture fields is an abundant source of long term data. We show that an agricultural pest can have the same periodic population cycles observed in perennial and unmanaged ecosystems.

When multiple natural enemy species share a host, shifts in host-parasitoid dynamics could depend on whether natural enemies interact antagonistically vs. synergistically. We investigated how biotic and abiotic factors influence the population ecology of larch casebearer (Coleophora laricella), a nonnative pest, and two imported parasitoids,Agathis pumilaandChrysocharis laricinellae, by analyzing (1) temporal dynamics in defoliation from 1962 to 2018, and (2) historical, branch-level data on densities of larch casebearer and parasitism rates by the two imported natural enemies from 1972 to 1995. Analyses of defoliation indicated that, prior to the widespread establishment of parasitoids (1962 to similar to 1980), larch casebearer outbreaks occurred in 2-6 yr cycles. This pattern was followed by a >15-yr period during which populations were at low, apparently stable densities undetectable via aerial surveys, presumably under control from parasitoids. However, since the late 1990s and despite the persistence of both parasitoids, outbreaks exhibiting unstable dynamics have occurred. Analyses of branch-level data indicated that growth of casebearer populations,A. pumilapopulations, and within-casebearer densities ofC. laricinellae-a generalist whose population dynamics are likely also influenced by use of alternative hosts-were inhibited by density dependence, with high intraspecific densities in one year slowing growth into the next. Casebearer population growth was also inhibited by parasitism fromA. pumila, but notC. laricinellae, and increased with warmer autumnal temperatures. Growth ofA. pumilapopulations and within-casebearer densities ofC. laricinellaeincreased with casebearer densities but decreased with warmer annual maximum temperatures. Moreover, parasitism byA. pumilawas associated with increased growth of within-casebearer densities ofC. laricinellaewithout adverse effects on its own demographics, indicating a synergistic interaction between these parasitoids. Our results indicate that warming can be associated with opposing effects between trophic levels, with deleterious effects of warming on one natural enemy species potentially being exacerbated by similar impacts on another. Coupling of such parasitoid responses with positive responses of hosts to warming might have contributed to the return of casebearer outbreaks to North America.",,,,,"Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008; Fei, Songlin/JTD-3325-2023","Ward, Samuel/0000-0002-3206-4880; Fei, Songlin/0000-0003-2772-0166",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,NOV,2020,101,11,,,,,,,e03156,10.1002/ecy.3156,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3156,,SEP 2020,,,,,,32740922,,,,,WOS:000564899900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent studies of decadal-scale change in Adelie penguin (Pygoscelisadeliae) populations around the Antarctic continent have led to insights into our understanding of the species' population dynamics and to exploration of the ecosystem processes driving them. However, gaps in knowledge of population change still exist for many populations, especially at breeding sites distant from research stations. In this study, we estimate population change for the large Adelie penguin populations at the seldom visited and data-poor Scullin and Murray Monoliths in East Antarctica by critically assessing historical population data and extending the historical time series of population data to the present day with a recent survey. Unlike Adelie penguin populations studied elsewhere in East Antarctica, we find the Monolith populations have remained stable or decreased slightly over the past 3-4 decades. The results indicate that spatially divergent processes are driving Adelie penguin population dynamics, and that these factors may not be sufficiently represented in current explanatory or predictive population models for this species.

Water temperature, river discharge, growth, recruitment success and the Gulf Stream Index co-varied until the late 1990s, indicating a gradual progression between periods of warm-and-dry and cold-and-wet summers. Since the late 1990s, there has been an increased prevalence of warm-and-wet summers, and recruitment success has oscillated between extremes on an almost annual basis. The north wall (northern boundary) of the Gulf Stream has been undergoing a displacement south since the late 1990s, and the speed and amplitude of the change appears to support the hypothesis that there was a regime shift in the climate of the North Atlantic Ocean.

This study analyses seasonal variation in the occurrence of oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and mussel (Mytilus edulis/galloprovincialis) larvae across European coastal waters at a synoptic scale (1000s of km) using standardised methods for sampling and molecular analyses. We tested a series of hypotheses to explain the observed seasonal patterns of occurrence of bivalve larvae at 12 European stations (located between 37 degrees N and 60 degrees N and 27 degrees W and 18 degrees E). These hypotheses included a model that stated that there was no synchronisation in seasonality of larval presence at all between the locations (null hypothesis), a model that assumed that there was one common seasonality pattern for all stations within Europe, and various models that supposed that the variation in seasonality could be grouped according to specific spatial scales (i.e., latitude, large marine ecosystems and ecoregions), taxonomic groups, or several combinations of these factors. For oysters, the best models explaining the presence/absence of larvae in European coastal waters were (1) the model that assumed one common seasonal pattern, and (2) the one that, in addition to this common pattern, assumed an enhanced probability of occurrence from south to north. The third best model for oysters, with less empirical support than the first two, stated that oysters reproduced later in the south than in the north. For mussels, the best models explaining the seasonality in occurrence of larvae were (1) the model that assumed four underlying trends related to large marine ecosystems, and (2) the one that assumed one common seasonal pattern for larvae occurrence throughout Europe. Such synchronies in larval occurrences suggest that environmental conditions relevant to bivalve larval survival are more or less similar at large spatial scales from 100s to 1000s of km. To unravel the underlying mechanisms for this synchronisation is of particular interest in the light of changing environmental conditions as the result of global climate change and the possible consequences for marine food webs and ecosystem services.

An increase in spatial synchrony (i.e., coincident changes in distant populations) of spring phenology is one of the most prominent climate responses of forest trees. However, whether temperature variability contributes to an increase in the spatial synchrony of spring phenology and its underlying mechanisms remains largely unknown. Here, we analyzed an extensive dataset of xylem phenology observations of 20 conifer species from 75 sites over the Northern Hemisphere. Along the gradient of increase in temperature variability in the 75 sites, we observed a convergence in the onset of cell enlargement roughly toward the 5 th of June, with a convergence in the onset of cell wall thickening toward the summer solstice. The increase in rainfall since the 5 th of June is favorable for cell division and expansion, and as the most hours of sunlight are received around the summer solstice, it allows the optimization of carbon assimilation for cell wall thickening. Hence, the convergences can be considered as the result of matching xylem phenological activities to favorable conditions in regions with high temperature variability.

We used generalized linear mixed models to analyze pollen cone production in 180 permanent plots in Ontario, Canada between 1992 and 2008. Pollen cone production increased with stand age, and large trees in sparsely-populated stands produced more pollen cones. Defoliation decreased the propensity of trees to produce pollen cones for at least two years. We also identified important patterns that are not explained by defoliation and stand characteristics. Pollen cone production is spatially synchronized among years, trees in central Ontario produced more pollen cones than trees in northwestern Ontario, and background cone production increased over time in the central region but not in more northwestern plots. Synchronized reproduction is common among tree species, but has not previously been noted for jack pine pollen cones.

There also exists extensive spatial synchrony in the onset of outbreaks over large geographic regions. Density-dependent mortality clearly limits high-density populations, but there is little evidence for strong regulation of low-density populations. Predation by small mammals appears to be the major source of mortality affecting low-density populations. but because these are generalist predators and gypsy moths are a less preferred food item, mammals do not appear to regulate populations in a density-dependent fashion. Instead, predation levels appear to be primarily determined by small mammal abundance, which is in turn closely linked to the production of acorns that are a major source of food for overwintering predator populations. Mast production by host oak trees is typically variable among years, but considerable spatial synchrony in masting exists over large geographic areas. Thus, it appears that the temporal and spatial patterns of mast production may be responsible for the episodic and spatially synchronous behavior of gypsy moth outbreaks in North America. This multitrophic relationship among mast, predators, and gypsy moths represents a very different explanation of forest insect outbreak dynamics than the more widely applied theories based upon predator-prey cycles or feedbacks with host foliage quality.",,,,,"Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-3896,1438-390X,,,,DEC,2000,42,3,,,,,257,266,,10.1007/PL00012004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00012004,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000166144800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent theoretical studies on population synchrony have focused on the role of dispersal.. environmental correlation and density dependence in single species. Trophic interactions have received less attention. We explored how trophic interactions affect spatial synchrony. 2. We considered a host-parasitoid coupled map lattice to understand how the self-organizing spatial patterns generated by such dynamics affect synchrony. In particular, we calculated the spatial correlation functions (SCF) associated with travelling waves, spatial chaos and crystal lattices. 3. Travelling waves were associated with cyclic SCF (called second-order SCF) that differed greatly from those seen in spatial chaos or crystal lattices. Such U-shaped patterns of spatial synchrony, which have not been predicted by single-species models, have been reported recently in real data. Thus, the shape of the SCF can provide a test for trophically generated spatiotemporal dynamics. 4. We also calculated the cross-correlation function between the parasitoid and the host. Relatively high parasitoid mobility resulted in high within-patch synchrony of the dynamics of the two species. However, with relatively high host mobility, the parasitoid dynamics began to lag spatially behind those of the host. 5.

Typically, annual harmonics are used to characterize the variation in the seasonal temperature cycle. However, an often overlooked feature of the climate seasonal cycle is the semi-annual harmonic, which can account for a significant portion of the variance of the seasonal cycle and varies in amplitude and phase across space. Together, the spatial variation in the annual and semi-annual harmonics can play an important role in driving processes that are tied to seasonality (e.g., ecological and agricultural processes). We propose a multivariate spatiotemporal model to quantify the spatial and temporal change in minimum and maximum temperature seasonal cycles as a function of the annual and semi-annual harmonics. Our approach captures spatial dependence, temporal dynamics, and multivariate dependence of these harmonics through spatially and temporally varying coefficients. We apply the model to minimum and maximum temperature over North American for the years 1979-2018.

Traditional approaches to understanding these declines focus on searching for climatic or other broad-scale extrinsic drivers. These approaches include multi-proxy studies that match reconstructed changes in tree abundance to reconstructed changes in precipitation or temperature. Although these correlative approaches are informative, they neglect the potential role of intrinsic processes, such as competition and dispersal, in shaping tree community dynamics. We developed a simple process-based community model that includes competition among tree species, density-dependent survival, and dispersal to investigate how these processes might generate abrupt changes in tree abundances even when extrinsic climatic factors do not themselves change abruptly. Specifically, a self-reinforcing (i.e., positive) feedback between abundance and survival can produce abrupt changes in tree abundance in the absence of long-term climatic changes. Furthermore, spatially correlated, short-term environmental variation and seed dispersal can increase the synchrony of abrupt changes. Using the well-studied, late-Holocene crash of Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock) populations as an empirical case study, we find that our model generates abrupt and quasi-synchronized crashes qualitatively similar to the observed hemlock patterns. Other tree taxa vary in the frequency and clustering of abrupt change and the proportion of increases and decreases. This complexity argues for caution in interpreting abrupt changes in species abundances as indicative of abrupt climatic changes. Nonetheless, some taxa show patterns that the model cannot produce: observed abrupt declines in hemlock abundance are more synchronized than abrupt increases, whereas the degree of synchronization is the same for abrupt decreases and increases in the model. Our results show that intrinsic processes can be significant contributing factors in abrupt tree population changes and highlight the diagnostic value of analyzing entire time series rather than single events when testing hypotheses about abrupt changes. Thus, intrinsic processes should be considered along with extrinsic drivers when seeking to explain rapid changes in community composition.",,,,,"Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008; Williams, John/KBC-5275-2024",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,FEB,2019,100,2,,,,,,,e02579,10.1002/ecy.2579,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2579,,,,,,,,30707453,,,,,WOS:000457618800012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Plant density is also positively related to disease levels. 3 Results from three subregions indicate that disease persistence depends on survival of infected plants behind the foredunes of protected beaches. Population extinction was more likely on beaches with greater wind exposure and sea access, with the latter also related to colonization consistent with the dispersal of Cakile seeds via ocean currents, 4 Although disease dynamics during the epidemic were similar across subregions, the severity of the epidemic varied significantly among these areas, suggesting that large-scale environmental factors may influence the timing and development of the epidemic. 5 Estimates of synchrony in disease dynamics indicated that populations within a subregion were significantly correlated with respect to epidemic development.

Nonlinear population responses to climatic variation may be a part of this difficulty, but they can also provide an opportunity to highlight the climate impacts through targeted survey designs. In particular, when species distribution ranges encompass consistent spatial gradients in climate (e. g. according to latitude or altitude), such gradients can be strategically included in the spatial design of population surveys as to facilitate comparisons of spatial synchrony patterns across and along the gradient. In that case, we predict that nonlinear impacts of climatic variation on population growth rates will result in anisotropic (direction specific) synchrony patterns in the sense that synchrony will drop faster with distance along the climatic gradient than across it. We provide an empirical case study to exemplify survey design and analyses. Of two sympatric species of geometrids, inhabiting an altitudinal gradient in subarctic birch forest, one (Operophtera brumata L.) showed anisotropic synchrony consistent with a strongly nonlinear sensitivity to climatic variation, whereas the other (Epirrita autumnata Bkh.) did not.

The regular emergence of periodical cicada broods across the United States is a phenomenon of longstanding public and scientific interest, as the cicadas of each brood emerge in huge numbers and briefly dominate their ecosystem. During the emergence, the 17-year periodical cicada species Magicicada cassini is found to form synchronized choruses, and we investigated their chorusing behavior from the standpoint of spatial synchrony. Cicada choruses were observed to form in trees, calling regularly every five seconds. In order to determine the limits of this self-organizing behavior, we set out to quantify the spatial synchronization between cicada call choruses in different trees, and how and why this varies in space and time. We performed 20 simultaneous recordings in Clinton State Park, Kansas, in June 2015 (Brood IV), with a team of citizen-science volunteers using consumer equipment (smartphones). We use a wavelet approach to show in detail how spatially synchronous, self-organized chorusing varies across the forest. We show how conditions that increase the strength of audio interactions between cicadas also increase the spatial synchrony of their chorusing. Higher forest canopy light levels increase cicada activity, corresponding to faster and higher-amplitude chorus cycling and to greater synchrony of cycles across space. We implemented a relaxation-oscillator-ensemble model of interacting cicadas, finding that a tendency to call more often, driven by light levels, results in all these effects. Results demonstrate how the capacity to self-organize in ecology depends sensitively on environmental conditions.

In turn, local stability scales up regionally if heterogeneous landscapes maintain spatial asynchrony across discrete populations-but not if large-scale stressors synchronize environmental conditions and biological responses. Here, we hypothesized that droughts could drastically decrease the stability of invertebrate metapopulations both by filtering out poorly adapted species locally, and by synchronizing their dynamics across a river network. We tested this hypothesis via multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models on spatially replicated, long-term data describing aquatic invertebrate communities and hydrological conditions in a set of temperate, lowland streams subject to seasonal and supraseasonal drying events. This quantitative approach allowed us to assess the influence of local (flow magnitude) and network-scale (hydrological connectivity) drivers on invertebrate long-term trajectories, and to simulate near-future responses to a range of drought scenarios. We found that fluctuations in species abundances were heterogeneous across communities and driven by a combination of hydrological and stochastic drivers. Among metapopulations, increasing extent of dry reaches reduced the abundance of functional groups with low resistance or resilience capacities (i.e. low ability to persist in situ or recolonize from elsewhere, respectively). Our simulations revealed that metapopulation quasi-extinction risk for taxa vulnerable to drought increased exponentially as flowing habitats contracted within the river network, whereas the risk for taxa with resistance and resilience traits remained stable. Our results suggest that drought can be a synchronizing agent in riverscapes, potentially leading to regional quasi-extinction of species with lower resistance and resilience abilities. Better recognition of drought-driven synchronization may increase realism in species extinction forecasts as hydroclimatic extremes continue to intensify worldwide.",,,,,"Sarremejane, Romain/H-8595-2019; Stubbington, Rachel/ABI-3913-2020; Ruhi, Albert/L-4207-2017","Sefton, Catherine/0000-0002-8157-0368; Stubbington, Rachel/0000-0001-8475-5109; England, Judy/0000-0001-5247-4812; Eastman, Michael/0000-0002-8212-5872; Ruhi, Albert/0000-0003-4011-6457",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,SEP,2021,27,17,,,,,4024,4039,,10.1111/gcb.15720,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15720,,JUN 2021,,,,,,34032337,,,,,WOS:000661628100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Theoretical models suggest that correlated environmental stochasticity, dispersal, and trophic interactions are important promoters of synchrony in nature to leave characteristic signatures of distance-dependent decays in synchrony. Recent refinements of this theory have clarified how distance-decay curves may steepen if local dynamics are governed by different density-dependent feedbacks and how synchrony should vary regionally if the importance and correlation of environmental stochasticity is location-specific. We analysed spatiotemporal data for the common vole, Microtus arvalis from 49 districts in the Czech Republic to examine the pattern of population synchrony between 2000 and 2014. By extending the nonparametric covariation function, we develop a quantitative method that allows a dissection of the effects of distance and additional variables such as altitude on synchrony. To examine the pattern of local synchrony, we apply the noncentered local-indicators of spatial association (ncLISA) which highlights areas with different degrees of synchrony than expected by the region-wide average. Additionally, in order to understand the obtained pattern of local spatial correlations, we have regressed LISA results against the proportion of forest in each district. The common vole abundances fluctuated strongly and exhibited synchronous dynamics with the typical tendency for a decline of synchrony with increasing distance but, not with altitude. The correlation between the neighbor districts decreases as the proportion of forest increases. Forested areas are suboptimum habitats and are strongly avoided by common voles. The investigation of spatiotemporal dynamics in animal populations is a key issue in ecology. Although the majority of studies are focused on testing hypotheses about which mechanisms are involved in shaping this dynamics it is crucial to understand the sources of variation involved in order to understand the underlying processes.",,,,,"Tkadlec, Emil/A-6230-2014; Gouveia, Ana/IUP-9888-2023; Bjornstad, Ottar/I-4518-2012","Tkadlec, Emil/0000-0003-3782-8867; /0000-0002-9711-4367",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,JAN,2016,6,1,,,,,212,218,,10.1002/ece3.1863,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1863,,,,,,,,26811786,,,,,WOS:000369164000017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climatic fluctuations are common drivers of spatial synchrony, and depending on the degree of synchronization and the parameters impacted, synchrony can increase extinction probabilities. Although citizen science is an inexpensive method to collect long-term data over large spatial scales to study effects of climate changes on wildlife, few studies have used citizen science data to determine if this synchrony is occurring across populations and species. We used 21 years of citizen science nesting data collected on Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) and Carolina Chickadees (Poecile carolinensis), two widespread North American species with similar life histories and abundant data, to assess the degree of synchrony between and within their populations in the southeastern United States. We found little evidence of synchronous fluctuations in the nesting parameters of hatching success, hatchability, and fledging success between and within species, nor did we observe consistent patterns towards increased or decreased synchrony. Estimates of nesting parameters were high (>= 0.83) and showed little variability (relative variance <= 0.17), supporting the hypothesis that parameters that strongly contribute to population growth rates (i.e., typically fecundity in short-lived species) show little interannual variability. The low variability and lack of synchrony suggest that these populations of study species may be resilient to climate change. However, we were unable to test for synchronous fluctuations in other species and populations, or in the survival parameter, due to large gaps in data. This highlights the need for citizen science projects to continue increasing public participation for species and regions that lack data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,NOV 16,2022,17,11,,,,,,,e0277656,10.1371/journal.pone.0277656,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277656,,,,,,,,36383623,,,,,WOS:000924954700069,View Full Record in Web of Science

The spatial structure of environmental variation may vary among ecosystems, for instance due to differences in the flow of nutrients, genes and individuals. However, inferences about ecosystem spatial scale should also include spatial autocorrelation in environmental stochasticity, such as fluctuations in weather or climate. We used spatially structured time series (19-36 yr) on temperature from 4 different ecosystems (terrestrial, limnic, coastal sea and open ocean) to assess the spatiotemporal patterns of environmental variation over large geographical scales (up to 1900 km) during summer and winter. The distance of positive spatial autocorrelation in mean temperature was greatest for the terrestrial system (range: 592-622 km), and shorter for the open ocean (range: 472-414 km), coastal sea (range: 155-814 km) and the limnic systems (range: 51-324 km), suggesting a stronger spatial structure in environmental variation in the terrestrial system. The terrestrial system had high spatial synchrony in temperature (mean correlation: winter = 0.82, summer = 0.66) with a great spatial scaling (>650 km). Consequently, populations of terrestrial species experience similar environmental fluctuations even at distances up to 1000 km, compared to species in the aquatic systems (<500 km). There were clear seasonal differences in environmental synchrony in the terrestrial and limnic systems, but less so in the other systems.

Strong population synchrony reduces species viability, but spatial heterogeneity in density dependence, the environment, or its ecological responses may decouple dynamics in space, preventing extinctions. How such heterogeneity buffers impacts of global change on large-scale population dynamics is not well studied. Here, we show that spatially autocorrelated fluctuations in annual winter weather synchronize wild reindeer dynamics across high-Arctic Svalbard, while, paradoxically, spatial variation in winter climate trends contribute to diverging local population trajectories. Warmer summers have improved the carrying capacity and apparently led to increased total reindeer abundance. However, fluctuations in population size seem mainly driven by negative effects of stochastic winter rain-on-snow (ROS) events causing icing, with strongest effects at high densities. Count data for 10 reindeer populations 8-324 km apart suggested that density-dependent ROS effects contributed to synchrony in population dynamics, mainly through spatially autocorrelated mortality. By comparing one coastal and one 'continental' reindeer population over four decades, we show that locally contrasting abundance trends can arise from spatial differences in climate change and responses to weather. The coastal population experienced a larger increase in ROS, and a stronger density-dependent ROS effect on population growth rates, than the continental population. In contrast, the latter experienced stronger summer warming and showed the strongest positive response to summer temperatures. Accordingly, contrasting net effects of a recent climate regime shift-with increased ROS and harsher winters, yet higher summer temperatures and improved carrying capacity-led to negative and positive abundance trends in the coastal and continental population respectively. Thus, synchronized population fluctuations by climatic drivers can be buffered by spatial heterogeneity in the same drivers, as well as in the ecological responses, averaging out climate change effects at larger spatial scales.",,,,,"Grotan, Vidar/A-4056-2008; Herfindal, Ivar/A-4609-2015; Hansen, Brage Bremset/B-9942-2008; ALBON, Stephen/C-6304-2011","Grotan, Vidar/0000-0003-1222-0724; Peeters, Bart/0000-0002-2341-1035; Herfindal, Ivar/0000-0002-5860-9252; Hansen, Brage Bremset/0000-0001-8763-4361; ALBON, Stephen/0000-0002-0811-1333; Le Moullec, Mathilde/0000-0002-3290-7091",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,NOV,2019,25,11,,,,,3656,3668,,10.1111/gcb.14761,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14761,,,,,,,,31435996,,,,,WOS:000489174400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The degree of relatedness typically declines with increasing distance between sampling locations. Standard approaches for assessing synchrony assume isotropy in space and uniformity across timescales of analysis, but it is now known that spatial variability and timescale structure in population dynamics are common features. We tested for spatial and timescale structure in the patterns of synchrony of freshwater plankton in Kentucky Lake, U.S.A. We also evaluated whether different mechanisms may drive synchrony and its spatial structure on different timescales. Using wavelet techniques and matrix regression, we analyzed phytoplankton biomass and abundances of seven zooplankton taxa at 16 locations sampled from 1990 to 2015. We found that zooplankton abundances and phytoplankton biomass exhibited synchrony at multiple timescales. Timescale structure in the potential mechanisms of synchrony was revealed primarily through networks of relationships among zooplankton taxa, which differed by timescale. We found substantial interspecific variability in geographic structures of synchrony and their causes: all mechanisms we considered strongly explained geographic structure in synchrony for at least one species, while Euclidean distance between sampling locations was generally less well supported than more mechanistic explanations. Geographic structure in synchrony and its underlying mechanisms also depended on timescale for a minority of the taxa tested.

Here, we investigate the spatial synchrony of seven indicators of coastal fish community status among eleven reference sites 2002-2014 in the Baltic Sea.

When ecological monitoring data are available, a before-after-control-impact (BACI) analysis can control natural spatial and temporal variation to better identify an impact and estimate its magnitude. However, populations with limited distributions and confounding spatial-temporal dynamics can violate core assumptions of BACI-type designs. In this study, we assessed how such properties affect the potential to identify impacts. Specifically, we quantified the conditions under which BACI analyses correctly (or incorrectly) identified simulated anthropogenic impacts in a spatially and temporally replicated data set of fish, macroalgal, and invertebrate species found on nearshore subtidal reefs in southern California, USA. We found BACI failed to assess very localized impacts, and had low power but high precision when assessing region-wide impacts. Power was highest for severe impacts of moderate spatial scale, and impacts were most easily detected in species with stable, widely distributed populations. Serial autocorrelation in the data greatly inflated false impact detection rates, and could be partly controlled for statistically, while spatial synchrony in dynamics had no consistent effect on power or false detection rates. Unfortunately, species that offer high power to detect real impacts were also more likely to detect impacts where none had occurred. However, considering power and false detection rates together can identify promising indicator species, and collectively analyzing data for similar species improved the net ability to assess impacts. These insights set expectations for the sizes and severities of impacts that BACI analyses can detect in real systems, point to the importance of serial autocorrelation (but not of spatial synchrony), and indicate how to choose the species, and groups of species, that can best identify impacts.",,,,,"Okamoto, Daniel/AFS-1308-2022; Lafferty, Kevin/B-3888-2009","Rassweiler, Andrew/0000-0002-8760-3888",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,JUN,2021,31,4,,,,,,,,10.1002/eap.2304,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2304,,MAR 2021,,,,,,33587791,,,,,WOS:000629624900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, persistence of a community as a whole depends both on the local interactions and the rates of dispersal between patches. We study a mathematical model of a metacommunity with two consumers exploiting a resource in a habitat of two different patches. They are the exploitative competitors or the competing predators indirectly competing through depletion of the shared resource. We show that they can potentially coexist, even if one species is sufficiently inferior to be driven extinct in both patches in isolation, when these patches are connected through diffusive dispersal. Thus, dispersal can mediate coexistence of competitors, even if both patches are local sinks for one species because of the interactions with the other species. The spatial asynchrony and the competition-colonization trade-off are usual mechanisms to facilitate regional coexistence. However, in our case, two consumers call coexist either in synchronous oscillation between patches or in equilibrium. The higher dispersal rate of the superior prompts rather than suppresses the inferior. Since differences in the carrying capacity between two patches generate flows from the more productive patch to the less productive, loss of the superior by emigration relaxes competition in the former, and depletion of the resource by subsidized consumers decouples the local community in the latter.

We examined spatial synchrony in 50 waterbird species using aerial survey data over the past three decades (1983-2016), across two of Australia's largest river basins, representing almost a third of the continent using state-space models. There was broad synchrony in the responses of Australian waterbird numbers in wetlands, varying among functional response groups, reflecting the spatiotemporal mosaic of flooded wetlands across multiple scales. Ducks, the most abundant functional response group, and herbivorous waterbirds displayed strong spatiotemporal synchrony within and between the Lake Eyre Basin and Murray-Darling Basin, while synchrony of piscivores was patchier. In contrast, large waders and particularly shorebirds had poor synchronicity. While rainfall among catchments within river basins was highly correlated, streamflow was correspondingly weakly correlated in the Murray-Darling Basin primarily because river regulation had separated rainfall from flow and inundation, potentially compromising waterbird response triggers. There are clear conservation implications for wetlands and their waterbird populations, principally the protection of natural flow regimes in the Lake Eyre Basin and where needed, restoration of environmental flows in the Murray-Darling Basin.

This important fungal pathogen is a major cause of larval death in invasive gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations in the United States. Airborne conidia of this pathogen are relatively large (similar in size to pollen), with unusual characteristics, and require specialized methods for collection and quantification. Initially, dry sampling (settling of spores from the air onto a dry surface) was used to confirm the detectability of E. maimaiga at field sites with L. dispar deaths caused by E. maimaiga, using quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods. We then measured the signal degradation of conidial DNA on dry surfaces under field conditions, ultimately rejecting dry sampling as a reliable method due to rapid DNA degradation. We modified a chamber-style trap commonly used in palynology to capture settling spores in buffer. We tested this wet-trapping method in a large-scale (137-km) spore-trapping survey across gypsy moth outbreak regions in Pennsylvania undergoing epizootics, in the summer of 2016. Using 4-day collection periods during the period of late instar and pupal development, we detected variable amounts of target DNA settling from the air. The amounts declined over the season and with distance from the nearest defoliated area, indicating airborne spore dispersal from outbreak areas. IMPORTANCE We report on a method for trapping and quantifying airborne spores of Entomophaga maimaiga, an important fungal pathogen affecting gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations.

Environmental conditions can co-fluctuate over large distances and thereby synchronise primary production in space. However, large-scale studies of such spatiotemporal patterns remain rare in the Arctic, where short time-series and poor spatial replication have characterised the data available on both biotic and abiotic parameters. Here, we use dendrochronological tools to measure ring growth of a dominant dwarf shrub, the polar willowSalix polaris, previously found to reliably trace community-level vascular plant biomass production. We investigated climate drivers of vegetation growth and their role in the synchronisation of primary production across the rapidly warming archipelago of Svalbard (n = 8 sites, composed of 17 sub-sites, 0.06-293 km apart). We found contrasting effects of summer versus winter weather on ring growth and its spatial synchrony. Although an overall positive effect of summer temperature caused spatially synchronous growth, negative impacts of winter rain-on-snow events occurred only locally, potentially counteracting such synchrony. However, the anticipated increase in both summer temperature and spatial extent of rain-on-snow events, causing basal ice encapsulation of the vegetation, could change the relative importance of seasons for spatiotemporal dynamics of shrub growth. Because these shrub ring growth chronologies reflect annual fluctuations in total vascular plant biomass, fuelling the bottom-up controlled food-web, these results have large implications for our understanding of how climate change shapes tundra ecosystem productivity in time and space.",,,,,"Buchwal, Agata/F-5516-2013; Grotan, Vidar/A-4056-2008; Hansen, Brage Bremset/B-9942-2008","Buchwal, Agata/0000-0001-6879-6656; Grotan, Vidar/0000-0003-1222-0724; Hansen, Brage Bremset/0000-0001-8763-4361; Le Moullec, Mathilde/0000-0002-3290-7091",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,JUL,2020,129,7,,,,,1012,1027,,10.1111/oik.07059,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.07059,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000544487100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We include two age classes, juveniles and adults, where juveniles are subject to logistic density dependence. There are environmental stochastic effects with arbitrary spatial scales on all birth and death rates, and individuals of both age classes are subject to density independent dispersal with given rates and specified distributions of dispersal distances. We show how to simulate the joint density fields of the age classes and derive results for the spatial scales of all spatial autocovariance functions for densities. A general result is that the squared scale has an additive term equal to the squared scale of the environmental noise, corresponding to the Moran effect, as well as additive terms proportional to the dispersal rate and variance of dispersal distance for the age classes and approximately inversely proportional to the strength of density regulation. We show that the optimal harvesting strategy in the deterministic case is to harvest only juveniles when their relative value (e.g. financial) is large, and otherwise only adults. With increasing environmental stochasticity there is an interval of increasing length of values of juveniles relative to adults where both age classes should be harvested.

J,"Holyoak, M",,,,"Holyoak, M",,,Effects of nutrient enrichment on predator-prey metapopulation dynamics,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. In certain predator-prey models, enrichment of nutrients produces large amplitude population oscillations that can cause extinctions; this effect has been termed the 'paradox of enrichment'. Metapopulation models also show that despite enrichment reducing the stability of equilibria in local populations, spatially subdivided populations may show bounded fluctuations because of asynchronous local density fluctuations. 2. Effects of enrichment and subdivided habitat structure were tested using two protozoans, predatory Didinium nasutum Muller and its bacterivorous prey, Colpidium striatum Stokes. A replicated experiment compared predator-prey dynamics in low, medium and high nutrient microcosms. Microcosms consisted of subdivided arrays of nine interconnected 30 mL bottles, undivided bottles of the same total volume (270 mt) and isolated 30 mt bottles. 3. Consistent with the paradox of enrichment, isolated populations produced greater mean predator densities at high nutrient concentrations than low or medium concentrations. The proportion of replicates in which predators drove prey extinct was also greater with high than with low or medium nutrient concentrations. 4. Enrichment increased prey density in all microcosm types. This is consistent with published predator-prey models where dynamics are mathematically unstable. 5. Predators and prey persisted longer in all subdivided microcosms than in undivided bottles. However, there were some unexpected changes in spatial dynamics with enrichment. For prey, direct or indirect effects of enrichment raised numbers dispersing, spatial synchrony of density fluctuations and variability in the number of patches occupied. 6. For predators in arrays, enrichment reduced the starvation rate, total numbers dispersing, and spatial synchrony. Time until recolonization of individual patches by predators was also longer in enriched microcosms, suggesting a possible decrease in the likelihood of regional persistence. A published simulation model produced qualitatively similar changes in dynamics with changes in prey and predator dispersal rate. 7. This study shows that spatial dynamics can potentially explain persistence of subdivided populations for long periods despite nutrient enrichment. However, the complex influence of enrichment on spatial dynamics illustrates the need to study more natural populations.",,,,,"Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009","Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,,,,,NOV,2000,69,6,,,,,985,997,,10.1046/j.1365-2656.2000.00453.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2656.2000.00453.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000166798000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Synchronous fluctuations of geographically separated populations are in general explained by the Moran effect, i.e. a common influence on the local population dynamics of environmental variables that are correlated in space. Empirical support for such a Moran effect has been difficult to provide, mainly due to problems separating out effects of local population dynamics, demographic stochasticity and dispersal that also influence the spatial scaling of population processes. Here we generalize the Moran effect by decomposing the spatial autocorrelation function for fluctuations in the size of great tit Parus major and blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus populations into components due to spatial correlations in the environmental noise, local differences in the strength of density regulation and the effects of demographic stochasticity. 2. Differences between localities in the strength of density dependence and nonlinearity in the density regulation had a small effect on population synchrony, whereas demographic stochasticity reduced the effects of the spatial correlation in environmental noise on the spatial correlations in population size by 21.7% and 23.3% in the great tit and blue tit, respectively. 3. Different environmental variables, such as beech mast and climate, induce a common environmental forcing on the dynamics of central European great and blue tit populations. This generates synchronous fluctuations in the size of populations located several hundred kilometres apart. 4. Although these environmental variables were autocorrelated over large areas, their contribution to the spatial synchrony in the population fluctuations differed, dependent on the spatial scaling of their effects on the local population dynamics. We also demonstrate that this effect can lead to the paradoxical result that a common environmental variable can induce spatial desynchronization of the population fluctuations. 5. This demonstrates that a proper understanding of the ecological consequences of environmental changes, especially those that occur simultaneously over large areas, will require information about the spatial scaling of their effects on local population dynamics.",,,,,"Fiedler, Wolfgang/AAG-4510-2021; Moller, Anders/O-6665-2016; Grotan, Vidar/A-4056-2008; Visser, Marcel E./A-9151-2009","van Pampus, Maria/0000-0002-3020-8908; Grotan, Vidar/0000-0003-1222-0724; Fiedler, Wolfgang/0000-0003-1082-4161; Visser, Marcel E./0000-0002-1456-1939",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,MAR,2007,76,2,,,,,315,325,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01195.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01195.x,,,,,,,,17302839,,,,,WOS:000244113100012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although arctic arthropods can complete their development at very low temperatures, the predicted climatic changes may shift their phenology outside its normal range. Hence, arctic arthropods may become exposed to conditions to which they are not adapted. On the basis of long-term data from several plots of pitfall and window traps at Zackenberg in high-arctic Northeast Greenland, we document that the timing of emergence is closely related to date of snowmelt in nine taxa of common surface-active and flying arthropods. Average air temperature seemed to play a lesser role, although the duration from snowmelt to the date when 50% of the individuals in the season were caught (date50) was negatively related to the average daily air temperature during the same time interval in three of the nine taxa. Since short-term weather fluctuations appeared to have a small effect on capture numbers in pitfall and window traps, we suggest that timing of snowmelt is a good predictor of the phenology of most arthropods in high-arctic Greenland. The spatial synchrony of capture numbers between individual traps within plots was high. However, among pairs of plots, the spatial synchrony varied between taxa and habitats and declined with distance, between plots for surface-dwelling taxa and with difference in timing of snowmelt for the most abundant families of Diptera (Muscidae and Chironomidae). Detritus feeders (collembolans, mites and most larvae of Diptera) and predators (spiders of the families Linyphiidae and Lycosidae) were abundant throughout the summer season. In contrast, the abundance of more specialized groups, like butterflies (e.g., Nymphalidae) and parasitoid wasps (e.g., Ichneumonidae), was restricted to a narrow seasonal time window in the warmest part of the summer. Because of their narrow phenological range and their host specialization, these taxa may be most vulnerable to trophic mismatch. Furthemore, snowmelt is predicted to become more variable, and this may affect organisms in areas of late snowmelt most severely.",,,,,"Forchhammer, Mads/I-7474-2013; Hoye, Toke T./A-7701-2008","Hoye, Toke T./0000-0001-5387-3284",,,,,,,,,,,,,0065-2504,,978-0-12-373665-9,,,,2008,40,,,,,,299,324,,10.1016/S0065-2504(07)00013-X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2504(07)00013-X,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000256528000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, cluster analysis on time series of outbreak activity revealed the outbreak developed at multiple incipient locations and spread to unaffected forest, highlighting the importance of both local-scale dispersal and regional-scale drivers in synchronizing spruce beetle outbreak. Spatial overlay analysis and Random Forest modeling of outbreak development show that outbreaks initiate in areas characterized by summer, winter, and multi-year drought and that outbreak spread is strongly linked to the proximity and extent of nearby outbreak, but remains associated with drought.

However, population dynamics of different host-associated biotypes of the same species, such as those of the larch budmoth (LBM), Zeiraphera diniana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), have never been compared. This species causes extensive defoliation of larch forests every 8 to 9 years in the Alps, but it consists of two genetically-differentiated host races, the first one developing on European larch, Larix decidua, and the other one developing on Swiss stone pine, Pinus cembra. The dynamics of Zeiraphera populations have been extensively studied on larch, whereas little is known about larval density and possible population fluctuations on sympatric pines. A larval census on Swiss stone pine was conducted in the Swiss Alps intermittently between 1958 to 2004 and in the French Alps from 1992 to 2004. Population density of Zeiraphera on pine varied up to 5000-fold and showed periodic oscillations, with five peaks in Switzerland and one in France. Because the feeding activity of the pine race is restricted to the elongating shoot of the current year, no conspicuous defoliation of pine trees was noted during years of high larval densities. Zeiraphera populations on pine oscillated in significant synchrony with larch-associated populations, and peak densities were observed either the same year or shifted by +/- one year. Our results did not allow any explanation for cyclic fluctuations of LBM on pine, but the synchrony with the larch race's cycle suggests that studies on genetics as well as on parasitism should be intensified.",,,,,"Choquet, Remi/F-6462-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,NOV,2006,115,2,,,,,299,307,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15010.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15010.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000241198800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Integrated population models (IPMs) can help alleviate that challenge, but they are often limited to narrow spatial or temporal windows owing to the financial and logistical burdens of acquiring requisite datasets. To expand the spatiotemporal scope of practical IPM implementation, we developed a novel method that expresses demographic relatedness among sampled and unsampled locations using geographic principles of spatial autocorrelation. We interpolated demographic parameters at unsampled locations using parameter estimates from data-informed locations. Errors attributable to the interpolative process were corrected using a joint likelihood and locally recorded count data ('cheaper' and broadly distributed). We evaluated the spatially interpolated IPM (SIIPM) for precision and accuracy under variable levels of spatial autocorrelation using simulated data and a Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) technique. Conventional IPMs and state-space models (SSM) were fit to the same simulated datasets to provide a comparative assessment of the novel method. In a final, empirical demonstration we fit the SIIPM to data collected from Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) populations located in Nevada, U.S.A. during 2013-2021. SIIPMs outperformed conventional IPMs when fit to data possessing moderate-to-high levels of spatial autocorrelation. Under moderate levels of autocorrelation, the average improvement in parameter estimation was 13.6% for survival, 65.3% for recruitment and 23.7% for rate of population change (lambda). When spatial autocorrelation was low, the SIIPM still outperformed contemporary approaches in areas that were geographically close (<67 km) to sampling locations. Under low autocorrelation-near distance scenarios, we observed SIIPM parameters that were 30.8% (recruitment), 32.5% (lambda; IPM comparison) and 54.0% (lambda; SSM comparison) more precise than contemporary models. Spatial autocorrelation is often assumed but rarely tested when comparing population dynamics across regions of large geographic extent. We demonstrated that SIIPMs can improve precision of species' vital rate estimation when extrapolating model inference beyond populations for which long-term monitoring data exists. Specific to sage-grouse, these results support previous conclusions of broad-scale spatial autocorrelation in population dynamics and a reproductive-survival trade-off previously documented at smaller scales.",,,,,"Aldridge, Cameron/F-4025-2011","Prochazka, Brian/0000-0001-7270-5550",,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,AUG,2024,15,8,,,,,1394,1407,,10.1111/2041-210X.14334,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14334,,JUN 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001255339900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, a twofold optimization is needed for achieving maximal spatial synchrony, thus indicating the existence of an optimal noise intensity as well as an optimal coupling strength. On the other hand, the traditional linear coupling via gap junctions, while still requiring a fine-tuning of the noise intensity, does not postulate the existence of an optimal coupling strength since the synchronization increases monotonously with the increasing coupling strength. Presented results reveal inherent differences in optimal spatial synchronization evoked by chemical and electrical coupling, and could hence help to pinpoint their specific roles in networked systems.

Whereas regional climatic factors may generate population synchrony (i.e. the Moran effect), local factors including the level of density dependence may reduce the level of synchrony. Although divergences in the scaling of population synchrony and spatial environmental variation have been observed, the regulatory factors that underlie such mismatches are poorly understood. Few previous studies have investigated how density-dependent processes and population-specific responses to weather variation influence spatial synchrony at both local and regional scales. We addressed this issue in a pond-breeding amphibian, the great crested newt Triturus cristatus. We used capture-recapture data collected through long-term surveys in five T. cristatus populations in Western Europe. In all populations-and subpopulations within metapopulations-population size, annual survival and recruitment fluctuated over time. Likewise, there was considerable variation in these demographic rates between populations and within metapopulations. These fluctuations and variations appear to be context-dependent and more related to site-specific characteristics than local or regional climatic drivers. We found a low level of demographic synchrony at both local and regional levels. Weather has weak and spatially variable effects on survival, recruitment and population growth rate. In contrast, density dependence was a common phenomenon (at least for population growth) in almost all populations and subpopulations. Our findings support the idea that the Moran effect is low in species where the population dynamics more closely depends on local factors (e.g. population density and habitat characteristics) than on large-scale environmental fluctuation (e.g. regional climatic variation). Such responses may have far-reaching consequences for the long-term viability of spatially structured populations and their ability to respond to large-scale climatic anomalies.",,,,,"Léna, Jean-Paul/AAH-4213-2020; Zakaria, Nurulhuda/A-3423-2019","Zakaria, Nurulhuda/0000-0002-9952-073X; PRIOL, Pauline/0000-0002-3120-2778",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JUN,2020,89,6,,,,,1350,1364,,10.1111/1365-2656.13208,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13208,,APR 2020,,,,,,32173904,,,,,WOS:000524966700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of the present study was to examine how climate affected spatial and temporal variation in demography within an insular metapopulation of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus). Daily weather conditions during the breeding season were highly correlated within the study region, and because the onset of breeding differed significantly among the five study islands, fledgling success was also affected. Thus, local recruitment was reduced by the occurrence of bad weather during the nestling period, and the asynchronous breeding phenology among the islands led to a significant island X year interaction in recruitment rate.

For a fixed time-delay, temporal resonance is shown to be degraded by increasing the rewiring probability of the network. On the other hand, for small rewiring probability, temporal resonance can be enhanced by an appropriately tuned small delay but degraded by a large delay, while conversely, temporal resonance is always reduced by time-delay for large rewiring probability.

In this study, we fit a stage-structured metapopulation model to a 29-year time series of threespine stickleback abundance in the heterogeneous and productive Lake MATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTEvatn, Iceland. The lake comprises two basins (North and South) connected by a channel through which the stickleback disperse. The model includes time-varying demographic rates, allowing us to assess the potential contributions of recruitment and survival, spatial coupling via movement, and demographic transience to the population's large fluctuations in abundance. Our analyses indicate that recruitment was only modestly synchronized between the two basins, whereas survival probabilities of adults were more strongly synchronized, contributing to cyclic fluctuations in the lake-wide population size with a period of approximately 6 years. The analyses further show that the two basins were coupled through movement, with the North Basin subsidizing the South Basin and playing a dominant role in driving the lake-wide dynamics.

Using long-term demographic data for wild birds across Europe, we show that productivity tends to vary between sites (consistently across years), while survival rates tend to vary between years (consistently across sites), and that spatial synchrony is more common in survival than productivity. Identifying the conditions associated with low demographic rates could therefore facilitate spatially targeted actions to improve productivity or (less feasibly) forecasting and temporally targeting actions to boost survival.

When synchrony decays exponentially with distance, IARs exhibit three phases, characterized by steeper increases in invariability at both small and large scales. Such triphasic IARs are observed for primary productivity from plot to continental scales. When synchrony decays as a power law with distance, IARs are quasilinear on a log-log scale. Such quasilinear IARs are observed for North American bird biomass at both species and community levels. The IAR provides a quantitative tool to predict the effects of habitat loss on population and ecosystem stability and to detect regime shifts in spatial ecological systems, which are goals of relevance to conservation and policy.",,,,,"Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012","de Mazancourt, Claire/0000-0002-3721-1069; Tao, Shengli/0000-0002-2145-4736; Wang, Shaopeng/0000-0002-9430-8879",,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-1723,,,,,MAY 19,2017,8,,,,,,,,15211,10.1038/ncomms15211,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15211,,,,,,,,28524860,,,,,WOS:000401624000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The adaptive coupling modulated by STDP can largely depress the temporal coherence and spatial synchrony induced by external noise and random shortcuts. In particular, as the adjusting rate increases, lower noise intensity is needed to maximize the networked synchronization, and more connections are introduced to achieve coherence resonance. Moreover, the small-world topology can significantly affect the dynamics of excitable neuronal networks.

High trophic level species such as parasitoids are disproportionally affected because they depend on unstable resources. Most parasitoid wasps have complementary sex determination, producing sterile males when inbred, which can theoretically lead to population extinction via the diploid male vortex (DMV). We examined this process empirically using a hyperparasitoid population inhabiting a spatially structured host population in a large fragmented landscape. Over four years of high host butterfly metapopulation fluctuation, diploid male production by the wasp increased, and effective population size declined precipitously. Our multitrophic spatially structured model shows that host population fluctuation can cause local extinctions of the hyperparasitoid because of the DMV. However, regionally it persists because spatial structure allows for efficient local genetic rescue via balancing selection for rare alleles carried by immigrants. This is, to our knowledge, the first empirically based study of the possibility of the DMV in a natural host-parasitoid system.",,,,,"Nonaka, Etsuko/J-7395-2019; Nair, Abhilash/AAE-4011-2019; van Nouhuys, Saskya/C-6813-2013","Nonaka, Etsuko/0000-0001-6563-2840; Nair, Abhilash/0000-0003-3487-1114; van Nouhuys, Saskya/0000-0003-2206-1368",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2945,,,,AUG 29,2018,285,1885,,,,,,,20180372,10.1098/rspb.2018.0372,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.0372,,,,,,,,30135149,,,,,WOS:000443163500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In support of this model, evidence from human and animal studies collectively reveals that the spatial synchrony of spontaneously occurring electrophysiological signal recapitulates BOLD rsFC networks. Two recent experiments from independent labs designed to specifically examine neuronal origins of rsFC, however, suggest that spontaneously occurring neuronal events, as assessed by multiunit activity or local field potential (LFP), although statistically significant, explain only a small portion (similar to 10%) of variance in resting-state BOLD fluctuations.

J,"Royama, T",,,,"Royama, T",,,Moran effect on nonlinear population processes,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,,,,,,,,,,,,"I investigate the efficacy of the Moran effect as applied to natural population processes. The Moran effect, the correlated density-independent disturbances that bring independently oscillating local populations into synchrony, was originally conceived as an attribute of a linear model system. However, it applies only approximately to natural populations. as they are inherently nonlinear in their density-dependent structure, given that no animal has an unlimited reproductive capacity. The degree of approximation, as measured by the degree of correlation among populations involved, is shown to depend, given the density-dependent structure, on the variances of the random disturbances. In particular, if the unperturbed density-dependent process converges to an equilibrium density, approximation is good when the variances are equal among the populations involved and comparatively small, but it worsens as the variances and their differences increase. For those processes that do not converge, when unperturbed, but exhibit bounded oscillations, the degree of approximation tends to deteriorate considerably, or may practically collapse, even if the disturbances are not large in variance. A sample correlation coefficient is often spurious if the observed population processes to be correlated are highly autocorrelated and limited in length. To detect spuriousness, the density-independent disturbances must somehow be estimated from the data. Three methods (moving-average, linear regression, and nonlinear regression) are considered, and their merits and demerits are discussed.

Defoliators cause extensive damage in boreal and temperate forests of the world. Considerable effort has been invested to understand their individual population dynamics, and despite ample theorising, there is little empirical evidence on factors causing spatial synchrony of pest eruptions at landscape scales.2. We report on the landscape-level effect of forest configuration and composition on the intensity of outbreaks of spruce budworm and forest tent caterpillar in a mixedwood boreal forest in northern Minnesota (USA) and adjacent Ontario (Canada), and how this is related to the degree of spatial synchrony in each species' outbreak cycling.3. Using a large spatiotemporal tree-ring reconstruction of outbreak impacts across these two systems, we evaluate two contrasting theories governing defoliator outbreaks: harmonic oscillation (a.k.a. 'clockwork') and relaxation oscillation (a.k.a. 'catastrophe'), each with consequences linked to top-down versus bottom-up influences on outbreak behaviour in time and space.4. We find synchrony varies temporally, among outbreak cycles and in direct proportion to cycle peak intensity; however, cycle peak intensities are distributed bimodally in time, and so, therefore, are synchrony coefficients. Spatially, the area where each pest species currently cycles with the greatest peak intensity and synchrony is where their preferred host trees are currently found in greatest proportion.5. Despite overall synchrony in cycling, we found, in both systems, a persistent negative spatial correlation among successive eruptive pulses of defoliation. Many of these eruptions failed to spread spatially and to coalesce with other spot eruptions to form extensive area-wide outbreaks. Eruptions often fail to spread at the hardwood-conifer interface, resulting in outbreak pulses that systematically bounce back and forth between landscape types, particularly when systems were cycling at low amplitude. These over-dispersed spatial patterns of pulse impact are consistent with a contagious theory of eruption and outbreak spread. They could be considered consistent with harmonic oscillation theory only for populations cycling at different frequencies, with cycling frequency determined by host forest landscape structure.6. Synthesis. We find that defoliator outbreak dynamics across systems include spatiotemporal signatures of each theoretical paradigm-suggesting a hybrid approach will better characterise outbreak behaviour. Host concentration influences which paradigm dominates the spatial dynamics in any given forest landscape context. Because of the synchronising effect of host concentration on forest insect spatial dynamics, mixedwoods appear to be less prone to intense, synchronised defoliator attack than forests of pure hardwood or pure conifer.",,,,,"Sturtevant, Brian/KHV-0383-2024","Thapa, Bina/0000-0003-2523-1641; Cooke, Barry/0000-0002-8347-9832",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,JAN,2024,112,1,,,,,152,173,,10.1111/1365-2745.14226,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.14226,,DEC 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001114915000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We here consider the dynamics of bank and field voles during more than two decades in two localities (170 km apart) in southern Finland. Using wavelet analysis, we show that a clear 3-year cycle disappeared in the mid 1990s.

In both localities, vole cycles were mainly determined by bank voles after the period of noncyclic dynamics, whereas field voles were dominant before this irregularity. Wavelet coherency analysis shows that spatial synchrony temporarily broke down during the period of noncyclic dynamics, but was fully restored afterwards.

Studies of phase synchrony predict that limited dispersal can drive either in-phase or out-of-phase synchrony, characterized by a constant phase difference among populations. We still lack an understanding of ecological processes leading to the loss of phase synchrony. Here, we study the role of limited dispersal as a cause of phase asynchrony defined as fluctuating phase differences among populations. We adopt a minimal predator-prey model allowing for dispersal-induced phase asynchrony, and show its dependence on species traits. We show that phase asynchrony in a homogeneous metacommunity requires a minimum of three communities and is characterized by the emergence of regional frequency modulation of population fluctuations. This frequency modulation results in spectral signatures in local time series that can be used to infer the causes and properties of metacommunity dynamics.

The hypothesis of food limitation as a key factor in determining population sizes, allows the prediction of the existence of positive correlations between these parameters. Location: The study was carried out in the Extremadura region, south-west Spain. Seven areas of pseudo-steppes were selected, characterized by large treeless plains devoted to un-irrigated cereal cultivations and/or extensive grazing grasslands. Climate is typically Mediterranean and semi-arid, with annual rainfall around 400-600 mm, mild and relatively wet winters, and very dry and hot summers. Methods: Bird communities were surveyed by means of point counts, placed along fixed routes which were repeated every year in the same spring dates (14 to 27 point counts in each locality). Surveys were conducted in five different years, three of them consecutive. Data regarding changes in rainfall were obtained from meteorological stations placed in or very close to the study areas. Results: Cumulative rainfall during the months preceding breeding bird censuses (January to April) showed significant inter-annual variations. Densities of several breeding bird species also exhibited important changes along the study period, especially noticeable among grassland or steppic species (those nesting in the ground), where they were statistically significant for most of the common species. Fluctuations among years of bird densities usually took place in parallel to those of rainfall. Average richness was positively correlated to rainfall in the whole of the breeding bird community, as well as in the steppic birds group, but it was not correlated to rainfall in the non-steppic birds group (species usually nesting in buildings or trees). Analysis of the variance by species allowed us to differentiate in the inter-annual variations the effects of years and localities. In only three steppic species there were significant changes mainly explained by differences between years and at the same time, showing a positive significant correlation with rainfall (Quail Coturnix coturnix, Fan-tailed Warbler Cisticola juncidis and Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra). On the other hand, there were species apparently not affected by rainfall, among them all or most belonging to the non-steppic group. Conclusions: The parallel and spatially synchronic fluctuations of cumulative rainfall, indices of vegetation growth, and densities of several grassland bird species, agree with a limiting role of the resources linked to vegetation, whose marked reduction during dry years would impose reductions in the population sizes of those species. Nevertheless, changes in rainfall and plant productivity do not affect many other bird species, among them all or most in the non-steppic group, making difficult to assume that the limiting factors are directly related to food (although insectivorous species may have fluctuated on average more than seed-eating species). An alternative or complementary explanation may link the decreases in abundances of certain species to the simplification taking place during dry years in the habitat structural complexity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0570-7358,2341-0825,,,,JUN,2005,52,1,,,,,53,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000232856900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Maximizing masting synchrony via spatial weather coordination, known as the Moran effect, requires a simultaneous response to weather conditions across distant populations. A celestial cue that occurs simultaneously across the entire hemisphere is the longest day (the summer solstice). We show that European beech abruptly opens its temperature-sensing window on the solstice, and hence widely separated populations all start responding to weather signals in the same week.

Temporal fluctuations in the timing of flowering were highly correlated across populations, both within and among species. Moreover, large-scale climatic fluctuation (the Arctic Oscillation) synchronized the timing of flowering across all three species over distances up to 500 kin.

Previous studies suggest that intermediate and density-dependent dispersal enables the functioning of a metacommunity, stabilizing populations at local and regional scales. Here, we consider a spatial ecological model with temperature-dependent traits to elucidate dispersal effects in stabilizing population dynamics under climate warming. Specifically, we analyze the effect of species temperature-dependent life-history traits on a metacommunity dynamics with diverse dispersal strategies (i.e., constant and density-dependent dispersal), tracked along with different dispersal rates of species (relative dispersal). At low and intermediate temperatures, different dispersal strategies synchronize or desynchronize the population dynamics depending upon dispersal rates. However, high temperatures completely synchronize the population trailing constant dispersal, weakening the stabilizing dynamics. Furthermore, density-dependent dispersal strongly affects the stability of metacommunity at high temperatures by increasing or decreasing spatial synchrony depending on dispersal rates. In metacommunities with many patches, conditional upon temperature, species abundance exhibits coexistence of synchronous and asynchronous oscillations, namely the chimera state. Overall, our results show that rising temperature may destabilize the dynamics by synchronizing populations; however, some dispersal mechanisms might impede the adverse outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1874-1738,1874-1746,,,,MAR,2022,15,1,,,,,81,92,,10.1007/s12080-022-00531-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-022-00531-3,,FEB 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000751233800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two well-known effects of dispersal are spatial synchrony (positively correlated population dynamics at different points in space) and dispersal-induced stability (the phenomenon whereby populations have simpler or less extinction-prone dynamics when they are linked by dispersal than when they are isolated). Although both these effects of dispersal should occur simultaneously, they have primarily been studied separately. Herein, I summarise evidence from the literature that these effects are expected to interact, and I use a series of models to characterise that interaction. In particular, I explore the observation that although dispersal can promote both synchrony and stability singly, it is widely held that synchrony paradoxically prevents dispersal-induced stability. I show here that in many realistic scenarios, dispersal is expected to promote both synchrony and stability at once despite this apparent destabilising influence of synchrony.

Two competing hypotheses concerning lynx population dynamics and large-scale spatial synchrony are currently debated. The first suggests that dispersal is substantial among lynx populations(5), and the second proposes that lynx at the periphery of their range exist in small, isolated patches that maintain cycle synchrony via correlation with extrinsic environmental factors(2). Resolving the nature of lynx population dynamics and dispersal is important both to ecological theory and to the conservation of threatened lynx populations: the lack of knowledge about connectivity between populations at the southern periphery of the lynx's geographic range delayed their legal listing in the United States(6).

Dispersal is commonly viewed as essential to the maintenance of diversity in spatially subdivided communities, but few experiments have explored how dispersal interacts with the spatiotemporal components of environmental perturbations to determine community-level stability. We examined these processes using an experimental planktonic system composed of three competing species of zooplankton. We subjected zooplankton metacommunities to varying levels of dispersal and pH perturbations that varied in their degree of spatial synchrony. We show that dispersal can reverse the destabilizing effects of environmental forcing when perturbations are spatially asynchronous. Asynchrony in pH perturbations generated spatially and temporally varying species refugia that promoted source`-sink dynamics and allowed prolonged persistence of zooplankton species that were otherwise extirpated in synchronously varying metacommunities. This, in turn, increased local species diversity, promoted compensatory population dynamics, and enhanced local community-level stability. Our results indicate that patterns of spatial covariation in environmental variability are critical to predicting the effects of dispersal on the dynamics and persistence of communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,,,,,AUG,2011,178,2,,,,,159,170,,10.1086/660835,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/660835,,,,,,,,21750380,,,,,WOS:000292917900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analyze global and local stability, as well as spatial synchrony in relation to trophic interaction strength and dispersal regimes. Results reveal that weak interactions can operate through two scale-dependent mechanisms: (i) under low local dispersal regimes, local stabilization of each community under weak interactions directly scales-up to global stability. (ii) Under high local dispersal, asynchronous local destabilization associated with weak interactions proves the driver behind global stability. In the face of enrichment, weak trophic interactions are shown to be instrumental in promoting global stability when dispersal is local. These results demonstrate how the importance of weak trophic interactions can be generalized at the landscape level despite contrary local predictions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

If environmental factors generally exhibit high levels of spatial autocorrelation. them may be playing a more important role in synchronizing animal populations than sometimes recognized. Here I examine this issue by analyzing spatial autocorrelation in annual rainfall and mean annual temperatures from sites throughout the world using the database maintained by the Global Historical Climatology Network. Both annual precipitation and mean annual temperatures exhibit high synchrony declining with distance and are statistically significant over large distance, often on a continental scale. In general, synchrony was slightly higher in annual precipitation at short distances, but greater in mean annual temperatures at long distances, No latitudinal gradient in synchrony of either variable was detected, The high overall synchrony observed in these environmental variables combined with a pattern of decline with distance similar to that observed in many animal populations suggest that the Moran effect can potentially play an important role in driving synchrony in a wide variety of ecological phenomena regardless of scale.",,,,,"Koenig, Walter/A-5509-2009","Koenig, Walter/0000-0001-6207-1427",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,,,,,JUN,2002,25,3,,,,,283,288,,10.1034/j.1600-0587.2002.250304.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0587.2002.250304.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000175943800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

We show that small delays can detriment synchronization in the network due to a dynamic clustering anti-phase synchronization transition. We also show that regions of irregular and regular wave propagations related to synchronization transitions appear intermittently as the delay increases, and the delay-induced synchronization transitions manifest as well-expressed minima in the measure for spatial synchrony. In addition, we show that the fraction of sodium or potassium channels can play a key role in dynamics of neuronal networks.

The study started in 1958, including old fields with different agricultural histories, landscape contexts, and times of abandonment. In each year of the study, the cover values of plant species were recorded in 48 permanent plots of 1 m(2) in each field. We analysed the temporal patterns of colonization at plot scale and related these to precipitation data and other community characteristics. The number of colonizing species decreased significantly after ca. 5 yr, coinciding with the development of a continuous canopy of perennial species. However, species turnover remained high throughout the whole successional sequence. The most remarkable phenomenon is the high inter-annual variation of all studied characteristics. We found considerable temporal collapses of vegetation cover that were synchronized among fields despite their different developmental stages and distinctive species compositions. Declines of total cover were correlated with drought events. These events were associated with peaks of local species extinctions and were followed by increased colonization rates.

We show that the dynamics of several taxa are characterized by similar patterns of abundance among lakes across the region, suggesting a synchronising effect of climate on zooplankton population abundances. Using multiple regression analyses to compare zooplankton dynamics with climatic and in- lake variables, we find that El Ni (n) over tildeo - Southern Oscillation ( ENSO) events and ice cover variability are among the most important predictors of synchrony at annual and seasonal scales, particularly for Leptodiaptomus and Bosmina. Leptodiaptomus, a dominant herbivore in these lakes, had decreased abundances in years with earlier ice- off dates and shorter periods of ice cover.

We quantified temporal coherence (i.e., spatial synchrony) of wetland invertebrate communities using intra-class correlations among 16 wetlands sampled continuously over 24 years to better understand the relative influences wetland heterogeneity (i.e., internal processes specific to individual wetlands and spatial connectivity and external processes occurring on the landscape) on wetland biodiversity. We found that while wetlands with different ponded-water regimes (temporarily ponded or permanently ponded) often hosted different invertebrate communities, temporal shifts in invertebrate composition were synchronous. We also found the relative importance of internal versus external forces in determining community assembly vary depending on a wetland's hydrologic function and climate influences. Our results confirm that heterogeneity and spatial connectivity of wetland landscapes are important drivers of wetland biodiversity.",,,,,"Sweetman, Jon/A-6457-2011","Sweetman, Jon/0000-0002-9849-7355",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,AUG 16,2022,10,,,,,,,,897872,10.3389/fevo.2022.897872,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.897872,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000847864300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present study we seek the expected relationship between synchrony and distance in populations that are synchronized by density-independent dispersal. In the absence of dispersal, synchrony among populations with simple dynamics has been shown to echo the correlation in the environment. We ask what functional form we may expect between synchrony and distance when dispersal is the synchronizing agent. We formulate a continuous-space, continuous-time model that explicitly represents the time evolution of the spatial covariance as a function of spatial distance. Solving this model gives us two simple canonical functions for dispersal-induced covariance in spatially extended populations. If dispersal is rare relative to birth and death, then covariances between nearby points will follow the dispersal distance distribution. At long distances, however, the covariance tails off according to exponential or Bessel functions (depending on whether the population moves in one or two dimensions). If dispersal is common, then the covariances will follow the mixture distribution that is approximately Gaussian around the origin and with an exponential or Bessel tail. The latter mixture results regardless of the original dispersal distance distribution. There are hence two canonical functions for dispersal-induced synchrony.",,,,,"Bjornstad, Ottar/I-4518-2012","Bolker, Benjamin/0000-0002-2127-0443",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,SEP 7,2000,267,1454,,,,,1787,1794,,10.1098/rspb.2000.1211,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2000.1211,,,,,,,,12233778,,,,,WOS:000089354500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

As the underlying model of neuronal dynamics, we use the efficient Rulkov map with additive noise. We show that increasing the coupling strength enhances synchronization monotonously, whereas delay plays a more subtle role. In particular, we found that depending on the inherent oscillation frequency of individual neurons, regions of irregular and regular propagating excitatory fronts appear intermittently as the delay increases. These delay-induced synchronization transitions manifest as well-expressed minima in the measure for spatial synchrony, appearing at every multiple of the oscillation frequency. Larger coupling strengths or average degrees can broaden the region of regular propagating fronts by a given information transmission delay and further improve synchronization. These results are robust against variations in system size, intensity of additive noise, and the scaling exponent of the underlying scale-free topology. We argue that fine-tuned information transmission delays are vital for assuring optimally synchronized excitatory fronts on complex neuronal networks and, indeed, they should be seen as important as the coupling strength or the overall density of interneuronal connections.

Using fire-scarred trees, we inferred temporal (frequency and seasonality) and spatial (synchrony) attributes and regulators of the fire regime over three land-use periods (historical, suppression, modern) between 1702 and 2007. Patterns of fire frequency and synchrony were similar, but fire seasonality was dissimilar, between the historical and modern periods. Logistic regression and generalised linear mixed models identified a suite of variables representing fuels, climate and human land uses that were associated with the probability of a site burning. Combined, these results allow for valuable insights regarding past fire spread and variability in fire frequency throughout our study area.

The dynamics of many species throughout the Northern Hemisphere are influenced by a single large-scale climate system, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)(2,3), which exerts highly correlated regional effects on local weather(4). But efforts to attribute synchronous fluctuations of contiguous populations to large-scale climate are confounded by the synchronizing influences of dispersal or trophic interactions(5). Here we report that the dynamics of caribou and musk oxen on opposite coasts of Greenland show spatial synchrony among populations of both species that correlates with the NAO index. Our analysis shows that the NAO has an influence in the high degree of cross-species synchrony between pairs of caribou and musk oxen populations separated by a minimum of 1,000 km of inland ice.

We show that the predator has a larger spatial scale of population synchrony than the prey if the population fluctuations of both species are mainly determined by the direct effect of stochastic environmental variations in the prey. This result implies that in ecosystems regulated from the bottom up, the spatial scale of synchrony of the predator population increases beyond the scale of the spatial autocorrelation in the environmental noise and in the prey fluctuations. Harvesting the prey increases the spatial scale of population synchrony of the predator, while harvesting the predator reduces the spatial scale of the population fluctuations of its prey.

For the former case, we show that time delay in the coupling can dramatically enhance temporal coherence and spatial synchrony of the noise-induced spike trains. In addition, if the delay time r is tuned to nearly match the intrinsic spike period of the neuronal network, the system dynamics reaches a most ordered state, which is both periodic in time and nearly synchronized in space, demonstrating an interesting resonance phenomenon with delay. For the latter case, however, we cannot achieve a similar spatiotemporal ordered state, but the neuronal dynamics exhibits interesting synchronization transitions with time delay from zigzag fronts of excitations to dynamic clustering anti-phase synchronization (APS), and further to clustered chimera states which have spatially distributed anti-phase coherence separated by incoherence.

The Balearic Islands, a patchier population subunit, displayed a seasonal synchrony pattern mainly dependent on biological and oceanographic processes at local scales.

To develop control methods for alternate fruiting, it is essential to under-stand the strength of synchronisation at the individual and population levels of trees in orchards and the mechanism of alternate fruiting. In this study, in-phase/out-of-phase analysis was applied to the yield data of a 9562 pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) population, and the phase transitions and mode-locking in the orchard were revealed. Using a developed network model consisting of diffusively coupled chaotic oscillators on which common noise was imposed identically, the phase transitions, mode-locking, and 1/3 power-law scaling spatial correlation were confirmed mathematically. Furthermore, the manner in which three essential factors, i.e. common noise, direct coupling, and the cropping coefficient gradient, explain the spatial synchrony of the or-chard was elucidated. The proposed methodology based on nonlinear dynamics would be useful for pomology, forestry, and ecosystem management.",,,,,"Sakai, Kenshi/F-9248-2013; Hastings, Alan/O-6864-2019; Brown, Patrick/E-4085-2012","Sakai, Kenshi/0000-0002-7887-1709; Hastings, Alan/0000-0002-0717-8026",,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-0779,1873-2887,,,,DEC,2022,165,,2,,,,,,112764,10.1016/j.chaos.2022.112764,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2022.112764,,NOV 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000892294300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

(2) How are distributions of prey and sea ducks related to one another? and (3) What is the explanation for the spatial association between these two species? A winter concentration of long-tailed ducks on the order of 3 x 10(5) birds have been present near Nantucket Island and the Nantucket Shoals since the 1970s, and there is evidence of some concentration there since the late 1800s. Despite the difference in diet, the two duck species overlap in spatial distribution in relation to a prominent tidal front on the west side of Nantucket Shoals where nested swarms of pelagic amphipods and massive clam beds occur in persistent broadscale concentrations. Gammarid amphipods were collected seasonally by bongo tows over 39 yr (1977-2016), and Atlantic surf clams and ocean quahogs were collected by hydraulic dredge over a 34-yr timescale (1982-2016). Long-tailed ducks and white-winged scoters were counted during systematic low-level aerial surveys. Both long-tailed ducks and white-winged scoters associated with amphipod and clam aggregations at similar scales, and tracked amphipod and clam concentrations at larger spatial scales, up to similar to 30 km. These multi-scalar nested associations suggest that the sea ducks foraged within a hierarchical patch system structured by the tidal regime, and concentrated in areas of spatially anchored recurring prey, with highest densities in southwest areas. Enhanced concentrations of prey within a relatively narrow zone on Nantucket Shoals provide a predictable food resource to wintering sea ducks whose populations are in decline. As supported by our generalized additive models, we propose that the positive spatial associations among these species are at least partly explained by local enhancement or facilitation, whereby each species of duck derives foraging benefit from noting the location of aggregations of the other. This interaction will be important to the designation of marine protected areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,JAN,2020,11,1,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecs2.3002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3002,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000533913600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Assortative interaction has been identified as a fundamental mechanism for cooperation in the social dilemma games. Many studies have shown that spatial limitation can lead to cooperation evolution, but how spatial pattern shape the cooperation is studied rarely. In this paper, using a spatial model of eco-evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game, where the player's diffusion is incorporated definitely, we show that the diffusion can trigger out rich spatial patterns. These self-organized spatial patterns could profoundly affect the cooperation level and system stability. Totally, six types of patterns can be identified according to their influences on cooperation evolution. Cooperation is affected by the spatial configuration of population distributions: spot- or stripe-type pattern promotes the cooperation, but mixed form of them or spatial synchrony suppresses cooperation. In contrast, uniform pattern has no effect on cooperation. Meanwhile, the analysis of spatial autocorrelation about population distributions via local Moran index reveals that the difference of spatial correlations among adjacent sites may be responsible for the functional differentiation of such self-organized structures. Spatial diffusion arouses vastly different spatial patterns, which renders the spatial extension system greatly expands the survival region of cooperators, i.e., the game dynamics continues after the homogeneous system has collapsed. Those results are helpful to understand the function of spatial patterns in supporting cooperation and fostering behavioral diversity.

To address this need, we analyzed the spatio-temporal patterns of fire occurrence, size, and severity of large fires (> 405 ha) in the western United States from 1984-2010. We assessed the associations of these fire regime components with environmental variables, including short-term climate anomalies, vegetation type, topography, and human influences, using boosted regression tree analysis. Results showed that large fire occurrence, size, and severity each exhibited distinctive spatial and spatio-temporal patterns, which were controlled by different sets of climate and landscape factors. Antecedent climate anomalies had the strongest influences on fire occurrence, resulting in the highest spatial synchrony. In contrast, climatic variability had weaker influences on fire size and severity and vegetation types were the most important environmental determinants of these fire regime components. Topography had moderately strong effects on both fire occurrence and severity, and human influence variables were most strongly associated with fire size. These results suggest a potential for the emergence of novel fire regimes due to the responses of fire regime components to multiple drivers at different spatial and temporal scales. Next-generation approaches for projecting future fire regimes should incorporate indirect climate effects on vegetation type changes as well as other landscape effects on multiple components of fire regimes.",,,,,"Liu, Z/H-7536-2012","Liu, Z/0000-0002-0086-5659",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,OCT 14,2015,10,10,,,,,,,e0140839,10.1371/journal.pone.0140839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140839,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000363183100167,View Full Record in Web of Science

Conditions for stable synchronization in a system of linearly coupled predator-prey oscillators have been considered in the past. However, the spatial dispersal coupling may be relatively weak and may not necessarily lead to a stable, complete synchrony. If the coupling between oscillators is too weak to induce a stable synchrony, oscillators may be engaged into intermittent synchrony, when episodes of synchronized dynamics are interspersed with the episodes of desynchronized dynamics. In the present study we consider the temporal patterning of this kind of intermittent synchronized dynamics in a system of two dispersal-coupled Rosenzweig-MacArthur predatorprey oscillators. We consider the properties of the distributions of durations of desynchronized intervals and their dependence on the model parameters. We show that the temporal patterning of synchronous dynamics (an ecological network phenomenon) may depend on the properties of individual predatorprey patch (individual oscillator) and may vary independently of the strength of dispersal. We also show that if the dynamics of predator is slow relative to the dynamics of the prey (a situation that may promote brief but large outbreaks), dispersal-coupled predator-prey oscillating populations exhibit numerous short desynchronizations (as opposed to few long desynchronizations) and may require weaker dispersal in order to reach strong synchrony.

Climate affects migratory animals at different times and locations throughout their annual cycles. Using long-term (50-year) population trajectories from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, we evaluated climate effects throughout the annual cycle for 37 species of aerial insectivorous birds, a group experiencing widespread population declines and exhibiting extensive within-species spatial synchrony but limited among-species concordance in population trajectories. We assessed the effects of five large-scale climatic indices at two temporal scales (current year and one-year lagged), two measures of seasonal winds, and four measures of seasonal storms (hereafter winds and storms) to test hypotheses about the magnitude of climatic effects that may explain trend variation in population trajectories. Climate covariates - notably the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation - improved the fit of 77% of regional population models relative to temporal variation alone. Climate indices, particularly when lagged, had stronger effects than migratory winds and storms on population trajectories. Climate effects were strongest on swallows, diurnal migrants, northerly-wintering species, and western breeding populations, and weakest on nightjars.

In this paper, we introduce a new model for alternate bearing behavior. Similar to the well-known Resource Budget Model, our model is based on the balance between photosynthesis or other limiting resource accumulation and reproduction processes. We consider two novel features with our model, 1) the existence of a finite capacity in the tree's resource reservoir and 2) the possibility of having low (but non-zero) yield when the tree's resource level is low. We achieve the former using a density dependent resource accumulation function, and the latter by removing the concept of the well-defined threshold used in the Resource Budget Model. At the level of an individual tree, our model has a stable two-cycle solution, which is suitable to model plants in which the alternate bearing behavior is pronounced. We incorporate environmental stochasticity by adding two uncorrelated noise terms to the parameters of the model associated with the nutrient accumulation and reproduction processes. Furthermore, we examine the model's behavior on a system of two coupled trees with direct coupling. Unlike the coupled Resource Budget Model, for which the only stable solution is the out-of-phase solution, our model with direct coupling has stable in-phase period-2 solutions. This suggests that our model might serve to explain spatial synchrony on a larger scale. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a dataset representing three phases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks in village poultry in Romania, 2005-2006, spatio-temporal patterns were characterized. We first fit a set of hierarchical Bayesian models that quantified changes in the spatio-temporal relative risk for each of the 23 affected counties. We then modeled spatial synchrony in each of the three epidemic phases using non-parametric covariance functions and Thin Plate Spline regression models. We found clear differences in the spatio-temporal patterns among the epidemic phases (local versus regional correlated processes), which may indicate differing spread mechanisms (for example wild bird versus human-mediated). Elucidating these patterns allowed us to postulate that a shift in the primary mechanism of disease spread may have taken place between the second and third phases of this epidemic. Information generated by such analyses could assist affected countries in determining the most appropriate control programs to implement, and to allocate appropriate resources to preventing contact between domestic poultry and wild birds versus enforcing bans on poultry movements and quarantine.

Theories of alternate stable states have been used to predict regime shifts of ecosystems as equilibrium responses to sufficiently slow environmental change. The actual rate of environmental change is a key factor affecting the response, yet we are still lacking a non-equilibrium theory that explicitly considers the influence of this rate of environmental change. We present a metacommunity model of predator-prey interactions displaying multiple stable states, and we impose an explicit rate of environmental change in habitat quality (carrying capacity) and connectivity (dispersal rate). We study how regime shifts depend on the rate of environmental change and compare the outcome with a stability analysis in the corresponding constant environment. Our results reveal that in a changing environment, the community can track states that are unstable in the constant environment. This tracking can lead to regime shifts, including local extinctions, that are not predicted by alternative stable state theory. In our metacommunity, tracking unstable states also controls the maintenance of spatial heterogeneity and spatial synchrony. Tracking unstable states can also lead to regime shifts that may be reversible or irreversible. Our study extends current regime shift theories to integrate rate-dependent responses to environmental change.

Spindle density and synchronization properties are different in MEG versus EEG recordings in humans and also vary with learning performance, suggesting spindle involvement in memory consolidation. Here, using computational models, we identified network mechanisms that may explain differences in spindle properties across cortical structures. First, we report that differences in spindle occurrence between MEG and EEG data may arise from the contrasting properties of the core and matrix thalamocortical systems. The matrix system, projecting superficially, has wider thalamocortical fanout compared to the core system, which projects to middle layers, and requires the recruitment of a larger population of neurons to initiate a spindle. This property was sufficient to explain lower spindle density and higher spatial synchrony of spindles in the superficial cortical layers, as observed in the EEG signal. In contrast, spindles in the core system occurred more frequently but less synchronously, as observed in the MEG recordings. Furthermore, consistent with human recordings, in the model, spindles occurred independently in the core system but the matrix system spindles commonly co-occurred with core spindles. We also found that the intracortical excitatory connections from layer III/IV to layer V promote spindle propagation from the core to the matrix system, leading to widespread spindle activity.

Here, we review recent research showing how spatial patterns and interspecific interactions can influence population responses to harvesting in fluctuating environments. We highlight several pathways through which harvesting can, often inadvertently, influence the dynamics and resilience to environmental fluctuations of both harvested and surrounding non-harvested populations and species. For instance, spatial models have shown that harvesting is expected to influence the spatial synchrony of population fluctuations, both of the harvested species and its competitors, predators and prey, with implications for population extinction risk. Dispersal and interspecific interactions can cause responses to harvesting in areas and species that are not themselves harvested. Harvesting that selectively targets certain groups of individuals, either intentionally or through for example spatially biased harvesting, can amplify environmentally induced population fluctuations by biasing the population structure towards individuals that are more sensitive to environmental variation. On the other hand, harvesting can in some cases buffer populations against the density-dependent effects of harsh climatic conditions, which are probably more common than previously acknowledged. Recent advances in modeling are providing new predictions that are highly relevant under global warming and now need to be tested empirically.

The larva of the apple fruit moth rely on rowan berries, which in turn is attacked by the parasitoid wasp, Microgaster politus Marsh.

Berry production represented a two-year cycle in western but a three-year cycle in eastern Norway. The abundance of the moth and the parasitoid also varied across years and were spatially synchronized. The degree of spatial synchrony decreased and cyclicity became obscure with increasing trophic level. We attempted to assess two different components to the predator satiation, functional and numerical satiations, based on a simple population dynamics model. The observed pattern of seed predation testified that both of functional and numerical satiations were at work in this system. In a comparison at different locations, rowan trees with more variable berry production were more effective in reducing losses to the seed predator.

Yet, whether this positive linkage has diminished under climate change remains debated. Here, we used atmospheric CO2 measurements at Barrow (Alaska) during 1979-2020 to investigate the strength of temperature dependence of spring carbon uptake reflected by two indicators, spring zero-crossing date (SZC) and CO2 drawdown (SCC). We found a fall and rise in the interannual correlation of temperature with SZC and SCC (RSZC-T and RSCC-T), showing a recent reversal of the previously reported weakening trend of RSZC-T and RSCC-T. We used a terrestrial biosphere model coupled with an atmospheric transport model to reproduce this fall and rise phenomenon and conducted factorial simulations to explore its potential causes. We found that a strong-weak-strong spatial synchrony of spring temperature anomalies per se has contributed to the fall and rise trend in RSZC-T and RSCC-T, despite an overall unbroken temperature control on net ecosystem CO2 fluxes at local scale. Our results provide an alternative explanation for the apparent drop of RSZC-T and RSCC-T during the late 1990s and 2000s, and suggest a continued positive linkage between spring carbon uptake and temperature during the past four decades.

Estimation of the rate of those declines is still hotly debated, fuelled by a lack of standardised, systematically collected data. More than 24 million individual moths and aphids collected from 112 light traps and 25 12.2 m suction-traps, respectively, were analysed using mixed models. Our objective was to estimate the long-term trends in both groups based on annual totals recorded every year between 1969 and 2016. The models showed that two paradigms existed: Over 47 years, long-term linear trends showed that moths had declined significantly by -31%, but short-term trends indicated that there were periods of significant decline and recovery in most decades since the 1960s. Conversely, despite aphid annual totals fluctuating widely, this group was in a steady state over the long-term, with a non-significant decline of -7.6%. Sensitivity analysis revealed that moth trends were not driven by a group of abundant species, but the sign of the overall aphid trends may have been driven by three of the most abundant species. The spatial extent of moth trends suggests that they are extremely heterogeneous. Uniquely, moth declines were different among several habitat types, with robust significant declines found in coastal, urban and woodland habitats, but notably not in agricultural, parkland and scrubland habitats. Conversely, aphid trends showed spatial synchrony extending to 338 km, albeit with local variation.",,,,,"Blumgart, Dan/HLX-1359-2023; Bell, James/C-2247-2009; Shortall, Chris/B-1191-2016","Bell, James/0000-0003-1640-6120; Blumgart, Dan/0000-0003-2591-7686; Shortall, Chris/0000-0002-7175-5393",,,,,,,,,,,,,1752-458X,1752-4598,,,,MAR,2020,13,2,,,SI,,115,126,,10.1111/icad.12412,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.12412,,,,,,,,32215052,,,,,WOS:000517816900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent work suggests that aging may also have strong effects on seed production patterns of trees, but this potential confounding factor has not been considered in previous times series analysis of climate change effects. Using a 54 year dataset for seven dominant species in 17 forests across Poland, we used the proportion of seed-producing trees (PST) to contrast the predictions of the climate change and aging hypotheses in Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Larix decidua, Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, Quercus petraea, and Quercus robur. Our results show that in all species, PST increased over time and that this change correlated most strongly with stand age, while the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index, a measure of drought, contributed to temporal trends in PST of F. sylvatica and Q. robur. Temporal variability of PST also increased over time in all species except P. sylvestris, while trends in temporal autocorrelation and among-stand synchrony reflect species-specific masting strategies. Our results suggest a pivotal role of plant ontogeny in driving not only the extent but also variability and synchrony of reproduction in temperate forest trees.

The large majority of these forests are located in areas under forest management; thus, few studies have investigated outbreak-driven spruce mortality patterns unaffected by humans. Our study examined spruce mortality resultant from a beetle outbreak in a high-elevation, unmanaged forest over a 17-year span. We analyzed three tree-level survivorship and DBH datasets collected during pre-, mid-, and post-outbreak conditions to evaluate long-term mortality dynamics. We measured changes in mortality severity, topographic and stand structure characteristics, and stand complexity using ANOVAs, and we assessed five topographic and stand structure mortality predictors by employing boosted regression trees. Our results showed that though spruce mortality increased significantly over time, such increases were disproportionate with spatial synchrony. Moreover, the outbreak did not significantly alter the living stand structure and had little effect on stand complexity, exhibiting the effects of an outbreak that spread throughout the forest without causing major stand-level damage. Larger trees at higher elevations on south-facing slopes were targeted most frequently, particularly during the later stages of the outbreak. Aspect, elevation, and slope were the best predictors of mortality, demonstrating moderate forecasting ability. We showed that bark beetle outbreaks can operate on patch-scale gradients, affecting microhabitat conditions, without resulting in sweeping, stand-altering mortality. Small-scale outbreaks may increase forest resilience against more severe outbreaks in the future by creating canopy gaps that facilitate regeneration, which leads to more complex age and size structures within the stand.",,,,,,"Adamus, Michal/0000-0001-9550-7880; Szewczyk, Janusz/0000-0002-5925-5855",,,,,,,,,,,,,1612-4669,1612-4677,,,,JUN,2016,135,3,,,,,507,517,,10.1007/s10342-016-0949-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-016-0949-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000379525600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The procerebral (PC) lobe of the land mollusk Limax valentianus shows an ongoing oscillatory local field potential (LFP). Olfactory input increases both the frequency and spatial synchrony of the LFP oscillation by a nitric oxide (NO)-mediated mechanism, but how NO modulates the activity in a specific manner has been unclear. In the present study, we used electrical stimulation and NO uncaging to systematically analyze the response of the LFP oscillation and found phase-dependent effects on phase shifting and synchrony. The neurons that presumably release NO in the PC lobe preferentially fired at phases in which NO has a synchronizing effect, suggesting that the timing of NO release is regulated to induce a stereotyped response to natural sensory stimuli. The phase-response curve (PRC) describes the timing dependence of responses of an oscillatory system to external input. PRCs are usually constructed by recording the temporal shifts of the neural activity in response to brief electrical pulses. However, NO evokes a longlasting depolarization persisting for several cycles of oscillation. The phase-response relationship obtained by NO stimulation was approximately the integral of the PRC. A similar relationship was also shown for regular firing of mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells receiving step depolarization, suggesting the generality of the results to oscillatory neural systems with highly distinct properties. These results indicate novel dynamic effects of long-lasting inputs on network oscillation and synchrony, which are based on simple and ubiquitous mechanisms.",,,,,,"Hirono, Moritoshi/0000-0001-6068-1045; Watanabe, Satoshi/0000-0001-9821-7598",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2373-2822,,,,SEP-OCT,2016,3,5,,,,,,,0066-16.2016,10.1523/ENEURO.0066-16.2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0066-16.2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391930400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The cortical information integration theory hypothesizes that loss of consciousness during general anesthesia is associated with breakdown of long-distance cortical connectivity across multiple brain regions. However, what is the effect of anesthetics on neural activities at a smaller spatial scale? Methods: The authors analyzed a set of previously published eight-channel electrocorticogram data, obtained from a 14-mm-long linear array of electrodes in eight adult merino sheep during general anesthesia induced by sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, and enflurane. The S-estimator was applied to the bi-channel coherence matrix to construct an overall index called the SI, which is the entropy of the eigenvalues of the cortical coherence for each pair of channels within the multichannel electrocorticographic dataset. Results: The SI values increased similar to 30-50% from the waking to the burst-suppression states, and returned to baseline during recovery. The anesthetic-induced increase in synchrony was most marked in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands (P < 0.05). Using prediction probability (P-K) analysis, we found a significant correlation between the increase in spatial synchrony (as estimated by the SI at various frequency bands) and anesthetic-induced cortical depression (as estimated by the approximate entropy). Conclusions: The results suggest that it is feasible to use the SI to measure cortical synchrony, and over a local spatial scale of 2-14 mm, synchrony increased during general anesthesia.",,,,,"li, xiaoli/HTR-6961-2023; Li, Xiaoli/B-6565-2016; Li, Duan/A-3977-2017","Li, Xiaoli/0000-0003-1359-5130; Li, Duan/0000-0001-9102-0741",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-3022,1528-1175,,,,JUL,2013,119,1,,,,,81,88,,10.1097/ALN.0b013e31828e894f,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ALN.0b013e31828e894f,,,,,,,,23508217,,,,,WOS:000320579300018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Over small (within-site) distances of < 4 km, synchrony of acorn production between individual trees was significant but varied through time and, for coast live oaks Q. agrifolia, differed at two sites 135 km apart. On a larger geographic scale, valley Q. lobata and blue Q. douglasii oaks exhibited significant synchrony in most distance categories between trees and sites up to 135 km apart and, in the case of coast live oaks, up to the maximum extent of the transect. Spatial patterns over this geographic scale also differed among species, with valley and blue oaks, but not coast live oaks, exhibiting distinct declines in synchrony of acorn production with distance. Interspecific synchrony in acorn production was generally lower than that within species but still significant over the entire extent of the survey. Spatial synchrony between sites was to some extent related to the same environmental variables previously found to correlate with annual acorn production within a site, suggesting that the environmental factors determining acorn production locally also influence spatial patterns over larger geographic areas. These results demonstrate that mast-fruiting in oaks occurs not only on a widespread geographic scale but also across species. They also confirm that synchrony over large geographic areas and complex spatial patterns varying, in time can occur in systems where dispersal does not occur and thus environmental variability (the Moran effect) alone is likely to be driving spatial dynamics.",,,,,"Koenig, Walter/A-5509-2009; Knops, Johannes/AAA-8546-2020","Koenig, Walter/0000-0001-6207-1427",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,,,,,OCT,1999,22,5,,,,,499,506,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1999.tb00537.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1999.tb00537.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000082554700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Asynchronous fluctuations in biomass among populations lower the risk of simultaneous local extinctions and thus reduce the regional extinction risk. However, dispersal is often seen as passive diffusion that balances species abundance between distant patches, whereas ecological constraints, such as predator avoidance or foraging for food, trigger the movement of individuals. Here, we propose a model in which dispersal rates depend on the abundance of the species interacting with the dispersing species (e.g., prey or predators) to determine how density-dependent dispersal shapes spatial synchrony in trophic metacommunities in response to stochastic perturbations. Thus, unlike those with passive dispersal, this model with density-dependent dispersal bypasses the classic vertical transmission of perturbations due to trophic interactions and deeply alters synchrony patterns. We show that the species with the highest coefficient of variation of biomass governs the dispersal rate of the dispersing species and determines the synchrony of its populations. In addition, we show that this mechanism can be modulated by the relative impact of each species on the growth rate of the dispersing species. Species affected by several constraints disperse to mitigate the strongest constraints (e.g., predation), which does not necessarily experience the highest variations due to perturbations. Our approach can disentangle the joint effects of several factors implied in dispersal and provides a more accurate description of dispersal and its consequences on metacommunity dynamics.

Patients in a vegetative state pose problems in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Currently, no prognostic markers predict the chance of recovery, which has serious consequences, especially in end-of-life decision making. Objective. We aimed to assess an objective measurement of prognosis using advanced electroencephalography (EEG). Methods. EEG data (19 channels) were collected in 14 patients who were diagnosed to be persistently vegetative based on repeated clinical evaluations at 3 months following brain damage. EEG structure parameters (amplitude, duration, and variability within quasi-stationary segments, as well as the spatial synchrony between such segments and the strength of this synchrony) were used to predict recovery of consciousness 3 months later. Results. The number and strength of cortical functional connections between EEG segments were higher in patients who recovered consciousness (P < .05 to P < .001) compared with those who did not recover. Linear regression analysis confirms that EEG structure parameters are capable of predicting (P = .0025) recovery of consciousness 6 months postinjury, whereas the same analysis failed to significantly predict patient outcome based on aspects of their clinical history alone (P = .629) or conventional EEG spectrum power (P = .473). Conclusions. The result of this preliminary study demonstrates that structural strategy of EEG analysis is better suited for providing prognosis of consciousness recovery than existing methods of clinical assessment and of conventional EEG.

However, cephalopods are also strongly linked to seasonal environmental fluctuations owing to their short life cycles and single seasonal breeding. Therefore, population abundance critically depends on the success of breeding and recruitment from the previous year and the optimization of resources in a narrow period of favorable conditions. This adaptation of population dynamics is paramount in marked oligotrophic systems, such as the western Mediterranean Sea. We used monthly landings per unit effort (LPUE) to explore the spatio-temporal variability in seasonal patterns of three cephalopod species (Illex coindetii, Eledone cirrhosa and Octopus vulgaris). Common trends across the study area were characterized for each species. In all cases, seasonal patterns were geographically aggregated in relation to differences in local environment (i.e., primary production and surface hydro-climatology). Variability in the mean seasonal pattern over time was also investigated under contrasting environmental or population regimes. The mean seasonal trend was more pronounced in regimes of high-population densities, suggesting a density-dependent control that can modify the strength of the environmental forcing in the seasonal patterns. Our study also evidences a spatial synchrony in the seasonal fluctuations of LPUEs. Scales of synchrony ranged from 70 to 200km, indicating a patchy-aggregated spatial pattern as a part of complex population structures in the western Mediterranean.

Although predators are central to the favoured mechanism to explain Fennoscandian vole cycles and the spatial variation of small mammal populations, their role in vole cycles elsewhere, including France, is less clear. Establishing whether alternative prey species in France cycle in parallel with voles as they do in Fennoscandia is thus an important step towards understanding the generality of predators' influence on cyclic vole populations. We applied spatial and temporal autocorrelation and cross-correlation methods to French populations of M. arvalis and two sympatric non-cyclic small mammal species, Apodemus sylvaticus and Crocidura russula. Patterns of time-lagged cross-correlation between the abundance of M. arvalis and the other two species suggested synchrony in their dynamics beyond that expected of stochastic environmental variation, and indicated a weak three-year cycle in A. sylvaticus and C. russula that was in phase with that of M. arvalis. We interpret the synchrony between these species as the effect of shared predators and environmental stochasticity. Abundance within species showed weak spatial autocorrelation in June at scales consistent with dispersal being the mechanism responsible, but a more general lack of spatial structure within and between species was consistent with the strong spatial synchrony at regional scales often found in fluctuations of small mammal abundance.",,,,,"Cornulier, Thomas/G-6841-2014","Cornulier, Thomas/0000-0003-2738-4801",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,APR,2011,34,2,,,,,327,335,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06334.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06334.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000289150000015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Spruce budworm can defoliate millions of hectares of forest during an infestation, depressing regional economies that depend on the timber industry. Ecosystems, though, can benefit from spruce budworm because outbreaks rejuvenate the forest, maintaining optimal levels of primary production, and thereby carbon sequestration. Although many ecologists, entomologists, geographers, and resource managers have studied the effects of spruce budworm on spruce-fir forests throughout the region, no single explanation of what causes the number of insects in a forest to rise and fall is universally accepted. Spruce budworm populations can reach 'outbreak' levels, or densities high enough to defoliate and kill balsam fir and spruce on a landscape scale, on average every 30-40 years. We review the biology of spruce budworm, the processes that scientists follow to reconstruct spruce budworm outbreaks, the leading hypothesis to explain population dynamics and outbreak events, and the complexity of forecasting possible future trends of populations and distributions of spruce budworm. Reconstructions of past outbreaks help us understand their severity, frequency, and spatial synchrony, which might be linked in complex ways to climate, forest, and stand characteristics. Future spruce budworm dynamics are difficult to predict because the insect is part of a complex food web.

Using fNIRS, we compared cortical activation patterns between children and adults during action observation, execution, and IPS. Seventeen school-age children and 15 adults completed a reach to cleanup task while we obtained cortical activation data from bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and inferior parietal lobes (IPL). Children showed lower spatial and temporal accuracy during IPS compared to adults (i.e., spatial synchrony scores (Mean +/- SE) in children: 2.67 +/- 0.08 and adults: 2.85 +/- 0.06; temporal synchrony scores (Mean +/- SE) in children: 2.74 +/- 0.06 and adults: 2.88 +/- 0.05). For both groups, the STS regions were more activated during action observation, while the IFG and STS were more activated during action execution and IPS. The IPS condition involved more right-sided activation compared to action execution suggesting that IPS is a higher-order process involving more bilateral cortical activation.

A key cell type in the inflammatory process is the macrophage, which can respond in various ways, depending on the conditions of stimulation. The aim of this study is to compare the activities of macrophages or microglia when encountering CNS and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), on the assumption that nerve-related differences in the inflammatory response may have implications for tissue repair and thus for nerve regeneration. Phagocytic activity of macrophages or of isolated brain-derived microglia was enhanced upon their exposure to sciatic (PNS) nerve segments, but inhibited by exposure to optic (CNS) nerve segments. Similarly, nitric oxide production by macrophages or microglia was induced by sciatic nerve segments but not by optic nerve segments. The previously demonstrated presence of a resident inhibitory activity in CNS nerve, could account, at least in part, for the inhibited phagocytic activity of blood-borne macrophages in CNS nerve as well as of microglia resident in the brain. It seems that the CNS microglia are reversibly immunosuppressed by the CNS environment, at least with respect to the activities examined here. It also appears from this study that the weak induction of early healing-related activities of macrophages/microglia in the environment of CNS might explain the subsequent failure of this environment to acquire growth-supportive properties in temporal and spatial synchrony with the needs of regrowing axons.

Stand structure characteristics, topographic factors (slope, elevation, and aspect), and solar equinox radiation were tested as predictors of mortality for multiple stages in the outbreak using boosted regression tree modeling. Our findings showed that: (1) spatial synchrony was not reflective of mortality severity; (2) mortality rates increased significantly as the outbreak progressed; (3) the stand's structure was altered significantly by the outbreak (larger trees were killed most frequently); (4) stand structure characteristics were the best predictors of mortality in all stages of the outbreak, though topographic factors and solar equinox radiation also exhibited moderate to strong predictive power in some stages; and (5) stand complexity decreased significantly as the outbreak progressed.

In Central Europe, the response of ecosystem management to increasing infestation risk has hitherto focused largely on the stand level, while the contingency of outbreak dynamics on large-scale drivers remains poorly understood. To investigate how factors beyond the local scale contribute to the infestation risk from Ips typographus (Col., Scol.), we analysed drivers across seven orders of magnitude in scale (from 10(3) to 10(10)m(2)) over a 23-year period, focusing on the Bavarian Forest National Park. Time-discrete hazard modelling was used to account for local factors and temporal dependencies. Subsequently, beta regression was applied to determine the influence of regional and landscape factors, the latter characterized by means of graph theory. We found that in addition to stand variables, large-scale drivers also strongly influenced bark beetle infestation risk. Outbreak waves were closely related to landscape-scale connectedness of both host and beetle populations as well as to regional bark beetle infestation levels. Furthermore, regional summer drought was identified as an important trigger for infestation pulses. Large-scale synchrony and connectivity are thus key drivers of the recently observed bark beetle outbreak in the area.Synthesis and applications. Our multiscale analysis provides evidence that the risk for biotic disturbances is highly dependent on drivers beyond the control of traditional stand-scale management.

Specific task-induced (evoked) gamma oscillations have often been taken as an indication of synchrony, but the presence of long-range synchrony cannot be inferred from spectral power in the gamma range. We studied the usefulness of a relatively new measure, called similarity index to detect asymmetric interdependency between two brain regions. Spontaneous EEG from two groups-musicians and non-musicians-were recorded during several states: listening to music, listening to text, and at rest (eyes closed and eyes open). While listening to music, degrees of the gamma band synchrony over distributed cortical areas were found to be significantly higher in musicians than non-musicians. Yet no differences between these two groups were found at resting conditions and while listening to a neutral text. In contrast to the degree of long-range synchrony, spectral power in the gamma band was higher in non-musicians. The degree of spatial synchrony, a measure of signal complexity based on eigen-decomposition method, was also significantly increased in musicians while listening to music. As compared with non-musicians, the finding of increased long-range synchrony in musicians independent of spectral power is interpreted as a manifestation of a more advanced musical memory of musicians in binding together several features of the intrinsic complexity of music in a dynamical way.",,,,,"Bhattacharya, Joydeep/HSG-3653-2023; Pereda, Ernesto/K-5185-2014","Pereda, Ernesto/0000-0001-5965-164X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0270-6474,1529-2401,,,,AUG 15,2001,21,16,,,,,6329,6337,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-16-06329.2001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-16-06329.2001,,,,,,,,11487656,,,,,WOS:000170318200054,View Full Record in Web of Science

We hypothesise that population growth in the increase phase of the cycle is enhanced by a high degree of space sharing (sociality) among reproductive females who share resource patches, especially during winter. These social females enjoy a high reproductive output due to good resource conditions, and facilitation provided by communal thermoregulation, breeding and defence of weanlings towards infanticidal conspecifics. We hypothesise on the other hand that the crash phase is initiated and enhanced by predation of adult males that leads to a series of cascading events involving infanticidal behaviour by immigrant males, increased mortality of adult social females, and inversely density-dependent and/or disturbance-induced dispersal. These events further enhance predation-induced mortality and thus a negative feed-back loop to the rate of the crash. In this framework we may explain how extrinsic factors such as predation and winter resource distribution contribute to transitions between docile and aggressive behaviours, and how this transition is spatially synchronised by inversely density-dependent dispersal that may act to mediate a rapidly spreading wave throughout the population. We propose that innate differences among rodent species in their propensities for different social organizations also determine their propensity for exhibiting multi-annual cycles as well as other cycle-related phenomena such as shape of the population cycles and spatial synchrony.

Invertebrate community composition did not show recovery following drought. The primary environmental factors influencing community composition, identified through principle components and multiple correspondence analyses were precipitation and flow permanence. Invertebrate taxon richness and abundance exhibited few responses (some site specific) and recovered quickly. Native fish abundance was lowest during the drought period and highest during the wet years that occurred at the end of the study period. Importantly, the prolonged drought facilitated the establishment and success of the invasive green sunfish (Centrarchidae: Lepomis cyanellus) that was then resilient to subsequent large flow events. There was high spatial synchrony in the temporal changes among all four sites, and three distinct periods were identified: early drought, late drought, and post-drought years. However, we still found differences among sites along the flow permanence gradient from temporary to perennial in the response to drought of both invertebrate and fish assemblages likely as a result of changes in substrate, vegetation, and other habitat characteristics.

As estimates of NPP in forests are scaled from trees to stands to the landscape, an understanding of the relative effects of these factors on spatial and temporal behavior of NPP is important. Although a high degree of spatial coherence (i.e., the degree of spatial synchrony over time) is often assumed, this inherent behavior is rarely examined. Quantifying this term may improve future predictions as site-level estimates are scaled up spatially. We quantified the spatial coherence of bole biomass production (BBP) within and between trees, and bole-related NPP (NPPB) between sites-of varying age, elevation, moisture, and species-composition across a forested landscape in the western Cascade Range of Oregon. Within sites, individual trees with lower than average BBP were the most coherent. IAV of BBP increased as average tree BBP increased and spatial coherence was reduced. Among sites, NPPB was the most spatially coherent (r = 0.92) between young sites, while older sites and comparisons between age classes revealed a much larger range in spatial coherence (r = -0.18 to 0.85). Our findings indicate climate variability may be of greater importance for spatial coherence between young sites, and that intrinsic factors could be decreasing spatial coherence between older sites or sites not in close proximity.

Using dendro-chronological techniques, we quantified the spatiotemporal dynamics of a modern (late 1980s through the early 2000s) spruce beetle outbreak in Engelmann spruce on the Markagunt Plateau, Utah. Erupting beetle populations occurred in multiple areas across the Plateau over the course of similar to 8 years. Early in the outbreak, the timing of spruce mortality was strongly and predictably related to latitude, slope, aspect, stand structure, host species composition, and site productivity potential. Exogenous forcing from landscape-scale drivers such as winter minimum temperatures, summer maximum temperatures, and landscape-wide host suitability probably contributed to spruce beetle population success and heightened spruce mortality. As the outbreak progressed, the timing of spruce mortality became less well correlated to stand and environmental variables. The outbreak subsided when suitable host material was depleted, including smaller spruce in remote stands at the fringe of the spruce-fir zone. Tests for spatial and temporal autocorrelation of beetle-cased spruce mortality did not provide strong evidence for the common perception that spruce beetle outbreaks originate in a specific location (epicenter) and then spread across the landscape; rather, support for positive spatial synchrony of multiple, building populations during development of the outbreak was found. Based on these results, silvicultural intervention before the onset of an outbreak might mitigate Engelmann spruce losses; however, the same is almost certainly not true later in an outbreak of this scale and magnitude.

While terrestrial studies have treated synchrony mainly as a population-level concept, the majority of freshwater studies have focused on community-level patterns, particularly in lake planktonic communities. We used spatially and temporally hierarchical data on benthic stream invertebrates across six years, with three seasonal samples a year, in 11 boreal streams to assess temporal coherence at three spatial extents: 1) among regions (watersheds), 2) among streams within a region, and 3) among riffles within a stream, using the average of correlation coefficients for stream/riffle pairs across years. Our results revealed the primacy of strongly synchronized climatic factors (precipitation, air temperature) in inducing temporal coherence of macroinvertebrate assemblages across geographically distinct sites (i.e. Moran effect). Coherence tended to decrease with increasing spatial extent, but positive coherence was detected for most biological variables even at the largest extent (about 350 km). The generally high level of coherence reflected the strong seasonality of boreal freshwater communities. A hydrologically exceptional year enhanced the synchrony of biological variables, particularly total macroinvertebrate abundance. Regionally low precipitation in that year led to a substantial decrease in benthic densities across a broad spatial extent, followed by a rapid post-drought recovery. Coherence at the among-riffle (within-stream) extent was lower than expected, implying that local-scale habitat filters determine community dynamics at smaller spatial extents.

Myopia is attributable to elongation of the eyeball in response to defocused images that alter eye growth and refraction. It is known that the retina can sense the focus of an image, but the effects of defocused images on signaling of population of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that account either for emmetropization or refractive errors has still to be elucidated. Thorough knowledge of the underlying mechanisms could provide insight to understanding myopia. In this study, we found that focused and defocused images can change both excitatory and inhibitory conductance of ON alpha, OFF alpha and ON-OFF retinal ganglion cells in the mouse retina. The firing patterns of population of RGCs vary under the different powers of defocused images and can be affected by dopamine receptor agonists/antagonists' application. OFF-delayed RGCs or displaced amacrine cells (dACs) with time latency of more than 0.3 s had synchrony firing with other RGCs and/or dACs. These spatial synchrony firing patterns between OFF-delayed cell and other RGCs/dACs were significantly changed by defocused image, which may relate to edge detection. The results suggested that defocused images induced changes in the multineuronal firing patterns and whole cell conductance in the mouse retina. The multineuronal firing patterns can be affected by dopamine receptors' agonists and antagonists.

However, increased climate variability, driven by anthropogenic climate change, will likely enhance synchrony among spatially disparate populations. Population synchrony may lead to greater fluctuations in abundance, but the consequences of population synchrony across multiple scales of biological organization, including impacts to putative competitors, dependent predators or human communities, are rarely considered in this context. Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha stocks distribute across the Northeast Pacific, creating spatially variable portfolios that support large ocean fisheries and marine mammal predators, such as killer whales Orcinus orca. We rely on a multi-population model that simulates Chinook salmon ocean distribution and abundance to understand spatial portfolios, or variability in abundance within and among ocean distribution regions, of Chinook salmon stocks across 17 ocean regions from Southeast Alaska to California. We found the expected positive correlation between the number of stocks in an ocean region and spatial portfolio strength; however, increased demographic synchrony eroded Chinook salmon spatial portfolios in the ocean. Moreover, we observed decreased resource availability within ocean fishery management jurisdictions but not within killer whale summer habitat. We found a strong portfolio effect across both Southern Resident and Northern Resident killer whale habitats that was relatively unaffected by increased demographic synchrony, likely a result of the large spatial area included in these habitats. However, within the areas of smaller fishing management jurisdictions we found a weakening of Chinook salmon portfolios and increased but inconsistent likelihood of low abundance years as demographic synchrony increased. We suggest that management and conservation actions that reduce spatial synchrony can enhance short-term ecosystem resilience by promoting the stabilizing effect multiple stocks have on aggregate Chinook salmon populations and overall resource availability.",,,,,,"samhouri, jameal/0000-0002-8239-3519; , Andrew/0000-0002-8045-6141; Sullaway, Genoa/0000-0002-9794-2808",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,NOV,2021,90,11,,,,,2692,2703,,10.1111/1365-2656.13575,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13575,,OCT 2021,,,,,,34553382,,,,,WOS:000703873600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, an association exists between tissue coordination and aging, and investigating the evolution of tissue coordination with age is of interest. In the past decade, both common and heterogeneous aging processes among tissues were extensively investigated. The results on spatial association of gene changes that determine lifespan appear complex and paradoxical. To reconcile observed commonality and heterogeneity of gene changes among tissues and to address evolution feature of tissue coordination with age, we introduced a new analytical strategy to systematically analyze genome-wide spatio-temporal gene expression profiles. We first applied the approach to natural aging process in three species (Rat, Mouse and Drosophila) and then to anti-aging process in Mouse. The results demonstrated that temporal gene expression alteration in different tissues experiences a progressive association evolution from spatial synchrony to asynchrony and stochasticity with age. This implies that tissue coordination gradually declines with age. Male mice showed earlier spatial asynchrony in gene expression than females, suggesting that male animals are more prone to aging than females. The confirmed anti-aging interventions (resveratrol and caloric restriction) enhanced tissue coordination, indicating their underlying anti-aging mechanism on multiple tissue levels. Further, functional analysis suggested asynchronous DNA/protein damage accumulation as well as asynchronous repair, modification and degradation of DNA/protein in tissues possibly contributes to asynchronous and stochastic changes of tissue microenvironment. This increased risk for a variety of age-related diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer that eventually accelerate organismal aging and death.

I describe how a range of bottom-up effects could be generating complexity in these otherwise periodic systems. (1) The spruce budworm in Qu & eacute;bec exhibits aperiodic and asynchronous behavior at fast time-scales, and a slow modulation of cycle peak intensity that varies regionally. (2) The forest tent caterpillar across Canada exhibits eruptive spiking behavior that is aperiodic locally, and asynchronous amongst regions, yet aggregates to produce a pattern of periodic outbreaks. In Qu & eacute;bec, forest tent caterpillar cycles differ in the aspen-dominated northwest versus the maple-dominated southeast, with opposing patterns of cycle intensity between the two regions. (3) In Alberta, forest tent caterpillar outbreak cycles resist synchronization across a forest landscape gradient, even at very fine spatial scales, resulting in a complex pattern of cycling that defies simple forecasting techniques. (4) In the Border Lakes region of Ontario and Minnesota, where the two insect species coexist in a mixedwood landscape of hardwood and conifers, outbreak cycle intensity in each species varies spatially and temporally in response to host forest landscape structure. Much attention has been given to the effect of top-down agents in driving synchronizable population cycles. However, foliage loss, tree death, and forest succession at stem, stand, and landscape scales affect larval and adult dispersal success, and may serve to override regulatory processes that cause otherwise top-down-driven periodic, synchronized, and predictable population oscillations to become aperiodic, asynchronous, and unpredictable.

The species-insurance hypothesis predicts that asynchronous dynamics among species should reduce variability when biomass is aggregated either from local species populations to local multispecies communities, or from metapopulations to metacommunities. Similarly, the spatial-insurance hypothesis predicts that asynchronous spatial dynamics among either local populations or local communities should stabilize metapopulation biomass and metacommunity biomass, respectively. In combination, both species and spatial insurance reduce variation in metacommunity biomass over time, yet these insurances are rarely considered together in natural systems. We partitioned the extent that species insurance and spatial insurance reduced the annual variation in macroalgal biomass in a southern California kelp forest. We quantified variability and synchrony at two levels of organization (population and community) and two spatial scales (local plots and region) and quantified the strength of species and spatial insurance by comparing observed variability and synchrony in aggregate biomass to null models of independent species or spatial dynamics based on cyclic-shift permutation. Spatial insurance was weak, presumably because large-scale oceanographic processes in the study region led to high spatial synchrony at both population- and community-level biomass. Species insurance was stronger due to asynchronous dynamics among the metapopulations of a few common species. In particular, a regional decline in the dominant understory kelp species Pterygophora californica was compensated for by the rise of three subdominant species. These compensatory dynamics were associated with positive values of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, indicating that differential species tolerances to warmer temperature and nutrient-poor conditions may underlie species insurance in this system.

Understanding these dynamics is particularly important if the herbivore is prey for an apex predator of conservation concern because a decline in the prey could cause the predator to decline. We tested hypotheses about the roles of density-dependent and density-independent factors in the dynamics of 2 tropical ungulates, Rusa deer (Rusa timorensis) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa), in Komodo National Park, eastern Indonesia. We counted the dung of Rusa deer and wild pigs (a validated index of abundance for these 2 species) along permanently marked transects at 10 sites over 4 islands annually during 2003-2014 to estimate ungulate abundance. Ungulates were much more abundant on the 2 larger islands compared with the 2 smaller islands, with wild pig dung completely absent from the latter. During our 12-year study, Rusa deer abundance declined slightly on Nusa Kode and Rinca islands, did not change on Komodo Island, and increased on Gili Motang Island. There was a decline in abundance of wild pigs on Komodo Island and an increase on Rinca Island. Annual variation in population growth rate was strongly density-dependent and island-specific for both species, with annual rainfall and vegetation composition being relatively unimportant. Population growth rates of Rusa deer exhibited spatial synchrony, with synchrony declining with increasing intersite distance. Our findings confirm the importance of density dependence in the dynamics of tropical large herbivore populations. However, the strength of density dependence varied between species and spatially.

Low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to localize generators of EEG activity in separate frequency bands. Before CPAP-treatment, a significantly lower Omega complexity was found globally and over the right hemisphere. Due to CPAP-treatment, these significant differences vanished. Significantly decreased Omega complexity was found in the anterior region after treatment.

A narrow ecological niche is one factor that may cause species to inhabit a small range. We investigated whether specialized niches have made South African amphibians more vulnerable to range contractions. Location South Africa. Methods The South African Frog Atlas Project is a comprehensive dataset that combines a recent biological survey with historical species distribution data. It provided an opportunity to quantitatively compare range sizes, niche breadth and range size changes for amphibian species. An ecological niche factor analysis supplied comparative measures of climate and habitat niche breadth for each species. Niche breadth was related to range size changes using linear regressions. Ranges of species with narrow habitat niches were spatially compared to areas of high land transformation. Results Small range size was a significant predictor of range contractions for South African amphibians (R2 = 0.35). Furthermore, species with narrow habitat (R2 = 0.25) and climate (R2 = 0.21) niches had experienced more severe range contractions than species with broader niches. Among only endemic species, climate specialization (R2 = 0.27) became a better predictor of range size change than habitat specialization (R2 = 0.21). Habitat specialists were concentrated within two areas of endemism that also had higher than average (P < 0.0001) levels of land transformation. Main conclusions Small range size increased species' likelihood of experiencing range contractions. Narrow niche breadth was also a significant predictor of range contractions, indicating that specialization may contribute to higher decline risk in small-range species. The role of climate specialization in predicting range contractions among endemics emphasizes the potential impacts of climate change.

It is not yet clear whether similar mechanisms influence this region's fish fauna. Schizopygopsis malacanthus is limited to high-elevation rivers and lakes, and exhibits distinct adaptations to the mountains of, and near to, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Therefore, this species is a good candidate for investigating patterns of genetic variation resulting from palaeoenvironmental fluctuations in the Shaluli Mountains (China). Here, we used microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA control region sequences to analyze six populations of S. malacanthus collected from the Jinsha and Yalong River drainages. Genealogical analyses identified four maternal lineages and perhaps even four putative species, of which the Ouqu River lineage played a pivotal role during the course of the species' evolution. Two lineages from the Yalong River drainage did not cluster together, whereas those from different drainages grouped together, suggesting tectonic event impacts that possibly altered regional river drainages have been highly influential in population connectivity and gene flow. Population genetic analysis indicated that the geographic barriers and this species preference for higher elevations both played key roles in the divergence of S. malacanthus populations. Demographic tests suggested largescale spatial synchrony in population fluctuations of S. malacanthus, accompanying dramatic Pleistocene climatic oscillations.

It has been suggested that this phenomenon is caused by common environmental perturbations, mobile predators or dispersal movements. However, very little focus has been given to how the physical properties of the geographic area over which synchrony occurs, such as landscape composition and climate, affect spatial population dynamics. This study reports on the spatial and temporal properties of vole population fluctuations in two areas of western Finland: one composed of large interconnected areas of agricultural farmland interspersed by forests and the other highly dominated by forest areas, containing more isolated patches of agricultural land. Furthermore, the more agricultural area exhibits somewhat milder winters with less snow than the forested area. We found the amplitude of vole cycles to be essentially the same in the two areas, suggesting that the relative amount of predation on small rodents by generalist versus specialist predators is similar in both areas. No seasonal differences in the timing of synchronization were observable for Microtus voles, whereas bank vole populations in field habitats appeared to become synchronized primarily during winter. Microtus populations in field habitats exhibited smaller spatial variation and a higher degree of synchrony in the more continuous agricultural landscape than in the forest-dominated landscape. We suggest that this inter-areal difference is due to differences in the degree of interpatch connectivity, with predators and dispersal acting as the primary synchronizing agents. Bank vole populations in field habitats were more synchronized within the forest-dominated landscape, most likely reflecting the suitability of the inter-patch matrix and the possibility of dispersal.

However, temporal patterns of survival differed among species and between sites, where survival was synchronous among species within a site but asynchronous between sites for the same species despite their spatial proximity. Study streams differed in summer thermal regimes, which resulted in contrasting summer survival patterns, suggesting sensitivity of these fishes to warming. We found that interspecific synchrony was greater than spatial synchrony, where regional drivers such as temperature may interact with local habitat leading to differences in survival patterns at fine spatial scales.

The apple fruit moth,Argyresthia conjugella(Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae), is a pre-dispersal seed predator. Larvae feed on rowanberries (Sorbus aucuparia), and when rowanberry seed production is low (i.e., inter-masting), the moth switches from laying eggs in rowanberries to apples (Malus domestica), resulting in devastating losses in apple crops. Using genetic methods, we investigated if this small moth expresses any local genetic structure, or alternatively if gene flow may be high within the Scandinavian Peninsula (similar to 850.000 km(2), 55(o)- 69(o)N). Genetic diversity was found to be high (n = 669, mean He = 0.71). For three out of ten tetranucleotide STRs, we detected heterozygote deficiency caused by null alleles, but tests showed little impact on the overall results. Genetic differentiation between the 28 sampling locations was very low (average FST = 0.016, P < 0.000). Surprisingly, we found that all individuals could be assigned to one of two non-geographic genetic clusters, and that a third, geographic cluster was found to be associated with 30% of the sampling locations, with weak but significant signals of isolation-by-distance. Conclusively, our findings suggest wind-aided dispersal and spatial synchrony of both sexes of the apple fruit moth over large areas and across very different climatic zones. We speculate that the species may recently have had two separate genetic origins caused by a genetic bottleneck after inter-masting, followed by rapid dispersal and homogenization of the gene pool across the landscape.

Studies on biodiversity patterns should optimally relate different scales of temporal community variability to spatial variability. Although temporal biodiversity variability is often negligible compared to spatial variation, it may still constitute a substantial source of overall community variability in stream ecosystems. Boreal streams exhibit seasonally recurring environmental periodicity, which can be expected to induce synchronous dynamics of abiotic variables among sites, and consequently, to produce spatial synchrony of deterministically controlled biological communities with higher intra- than inter-annual community variability. 2. We sampled benthic macroinvertebrates in 10 near-pristine boreal streams on three different seasons (spring, summer, autumn) across 4 consecutive years in northern Finland. We aimed to identify the relative contributions of spatial, inter-annual, and seasonal variability to overall benthic biodiversity; and relate variation in benthic invertebrate communities to key environmental factors, particularly in-stream habitat diversity. 3. Among-site spatial variability was clearly the most important source of variation for both species richness and community dissimilarity. Of the two temporal scales, inter-annual variability contributed more to variation in taxonomic richness and seasonal variability slightly more to variability in community composition. 4. Only inter-annual variation differed systematically from random expectation, indicating strong stability (low variability) of stream macroinvertebrate communities across years, with less variation at sites with higher substrate heterogeneity. Considering the distinct seasonality of the boreal stream environment, seasonal variability accounted for an unexpectedly low amount of total community variability. 5. Although differences between seasons were small, autumnal sampling is likely to be the least susceptible to climatic vagaries, thus providing the most consistent and predictable conditions for benthic sampling in boreal streams, particularly for bioassessment purposes. Exceptional climatic conditions are becoming more frequent in northern Europe, probably causing substantial and largely unpredictable changes in benthic community composition.

As consistencies in the relative timing and direction of spread could form the basis for an early alert system, the objectives of this study were to use the case-based reporting system for laboratory confirmed influenza from the Canadian FluWatch surveillance program to identify the geographic scale at which spatial synchrony exists and then to describe the geographic patterns of influenza A virus across Canada and in relationship to activity in the United States (US). Methodology/Principal Findings: Weekly laboratory confirmations for influenza A were obtained from the Canadian FluWatch and the US FluView surveillance programs from 1997/98 to 2006/07. For the six seasons where at least 80% of the specimens were antigenically similar, we identified the epidemic midpoint of the local/regional/provincial epidemics and analyzed trends in the direction of spread. In three out of the six seasons, the epidemic appeared first in Canada. Regional epidemics were more closely synchronized across the US (3-5 weeks) compared to Canada (5-13 weeks), with a slight gradient in timing from the southwest regions in the US to northeast regions of Canada and the US. Cities, as well as rural areas within provinces, usually peaked within a couple of weeks of each other. The anticipated delay in peak activity between large cities and rural areas was not observed. In some mixed influenza A seasons, lack of synchronization sub-provincially was evident. Conclusions/Significance: As mixing between regions appears to be too weak to force a consistency in the direction and timing of spread, local laboratory-based surveillance is needed to accurately assess the level of influenza activity in the community. In comparison, mixing between urban communities and adjacent rural areas, and between some communities, may be sufficient to force synchronization.",,,,,"; Schanzer, Dena/G-1593-2011","Langley, Joanne/0000-0003-3270-7345; Schanzer, Dena/0000-0001-7093-4309",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JUN 28,2011,6,6,,,,,,,e21471,10.1371/journal.pone.0021471,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021471,,,,,,,,21738676,,,,,WOS:000292142800027,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dissolved N leakage is a common, well-documented response of forested watersheds to forest management practices such as clear-cutting. Patterns of N leakage from mid-Appalachian watersheds during the late 1980s and early 1990s have also been shown to display considerable temporal and spatial synchrony with outbreaks of defoliation by the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larva (a nonnative forest insect pest). This evidence suggests that forest disturbance may be an important contributor to N leakage in the mid-Appalachian region. A logical first step in testing this hypothesis is evaluating the ability of a simple, unit nitrogen export response function (UNERF) model to explain temporal changes in annual N export from gaged forested watersheds in the years following disturbance. Annual N export data from seven such watersheds were analyzed as part of the study: two small (<0.5 km(2)) watersheds subjected to deforestation and five larger (1.6-12.6 km(2)) watersheds subjected to repetitive defoliation by the gypsy moth larva. Several forms of linear UNERF models, parameterized by deconvolution of annual time series of N export using linear programming or by a least squares method, were generally found to be minimally biased and to explain high percentages (38-98%) of the total variation in annual N export. Despite their neglect of spatial and temporal ecosystem nonlinearities these linear models appear reasonably robust, making them at least as useful as their more complex nonlinear brethren for purposes of regionalization.",,,,,"Eshleman, Keith/J-6531-2015","Eshleman, Keith/0000-0002-8274-450X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,,,,,NOV,2000,36,11,,,,,3325,3335,,10.1029/2000WR900215,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000WR900215,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000090146100017,View Full Record in Web of Science

This contrasts to recent reports of fading cycles in arvicoline rodents in boreal and alpine Fennoscandia. We investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of boreal red fox and alpine arctic fox in Sweden as a proxy for the dynamics of their main prey, voles and Norwegian lemming, respectively. We analyse data from five decades, 1960-2008, with wavelets and autocorrelation approaches. Cyclic dynamics were identified with at least one method in all populations (arctic fox n = 3, red fox n = 6). The dynamics were synchronous between populations, or coupled with a 1-yr lag, in 8 of 13 pairwise comparisons. Importantly though, the dynamics were heterogeneous in space and time. All analytical approaches identified fading cycles in the three arctic fox populations and two northern red fox populations. At least one method identified similar patterns in three southern red fox populations. Red fox dynamics were cyclic in the 1970s primarily, while arctic fox dynamics was cyclic until the late 1980s or early 1990s. When cyclic, 4-yr cycles dominated in arctic fox and northern red fox, whilst 3-4-yr cycles was found in southern red foxes. Significant cyclic regimes reappeared in the 1990s or 2000s in two red fox populations and one arctic fox population. Cycles and regionally coupled dynamics appeared associated in northern arctic and red foxes. This study supports accumulating evidence which suggests that cyclic and synchronous patterns in the dynamics of lemmings and voles are nonstationary in space and time. Furthermore, the similar patterns of change in both fox species indicate that persistence of cycles is governed by similar mechanisms in lemmings and voles.",,,,,"Kindberg, Jonas/AAA-5058-2020; Elmhagen, Bodil/M-4444-2014; Angerbjorn, Anders/A-5982-2013","Hellstrom, Peter/0000-0001-5124-2534; Elmhagen, Bodil/0000-0001-5496-4727; Kindberg, Jonas/0000-0003-1445-4524; Angerbjorn, Anders/0000-0001-5535-9086",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-455X,1797-2450,,,,JUN 30,2011,48,3,,,,,167,179,,10.5735/086.048.0305,http://dx.doi.org/10.5735/086.048.0305,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000292428100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Both abiotic and biotic properties are more similar among neighboring than distant locations, and their temporal co-fluctuations also decrease with distance. P. A. P. Moran realized the ecological importance of such 'spatial synchrony' when he predicted that isolated populations subject to identical log-linear density-dependent processes should have the same correlation in fluctuations of abundance as the correlation in environmental noise. The contribution from correlated weather to synchrony of populations has later been coined the 'Moran effect'. Here, we investigate the potential role of the Moran effect in large-scale ecological outcomes of global warming. Although difficult to disentangle from dispersal and species interaction effects, there is compelling evidence from across taxa and ecosystems that spatial environmental synchrony causes population synchrony. Given this, and the accelerating number of studies reporting climate change effects on local population dynamics, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the implications of global warming for spatial population synchrony. However, a handful of studies of insects, birds, plants, mammals and marine plankton indicate decadal-scale changes in population synchrony due to trends in environmental synchrony. We combine a literature review with modeling to outline potential pathways for how global warming, through changes in the mean, variability and spatial autocorrelation of weather, can impact population synchrony over time. This is particularly likely under a 'generalized Moran effect', i.e. when relaxing Moran's strict assumption of identical log-linear density-dependence, which is highly unrealistic in the wild. Furthermore, climate change can influence spatial population synchrony indirectly, through its effects on dispersal and species interactions. Because changes in population synchrony may cascade through food-webs, we argue that the (generalized) Moran effect is key to understanding and predicting impacts of global warming on large-scale ecological dynamics, with implications for extinctions, conservation and management.",,,,,"Lee, Aline/AAL-9984-2021; Hansen, Brage Bremset/B-9942-2008; Herfindal, Ivar/A-4609-2015; Grotan, Vidar/A-4056-2008","Hansen, Brage Bremset/0000-0001-8763-4361; Herfindal, Ivar/0000-0002-5860-9252; Grotan, Vidar/0000-0003-1222-0724; Lee, Aline/0000-0001-9272-4249",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,NOV,2020,43,11,,,,,1591,1602,,10.1111/ecog.04962,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04962,,FEB 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000512815300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While seasonal dynamics of the influenza virus, such as time of onset and circulating strains, are well documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Influenza Surveillance System, an accurate prediction of timing, magnitude, and composition of circulating strains of seasonal influenza remains elusive. To facilitate public health preparedness for seasonal influenza and to obtain better insights into the spatiotemporal behavior of emerging strains, it is important to develop measurable characteristics of seasonal oscillation and to quantify the relationships between those parameters on a spatial scale. The objectives of our research were to examine the seasonality of influenza on a national and state level as well as the relationship between peak timing and intensity of influenza in the United States older adult population. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 248,889 hospitalization records were extracted from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the influenza seasons 1991-2004. Harmonic regression models were used to quantify the peak timing and absolute intensity for each of the 48 contiguous states and Washington, DC. We found that individual influenza seasons showed spatial synchrony with consistent late or early timing occurring across all 48 states during each influenza season in comparison to the overall average. On a national level, seasons that had an earlier peak also had higher rates of influenza (r(s) = -0.5). We demonstrated a spatial trend in peak timing of influenza; western states such as Nevada, Utah, and California peaked earlier and New England States such as Rhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire peaked later.

Although the importance of these subsidies for riverine ecosystems is increasingly recognized, little is known about how they may be influenced by global environmental change. Drawing from available evidence, in this review we propose a conceptual framework to evaluate the effects of global change on the quality and spatiotemporal dynamics of stream-terrestrial subsidies. We illustrate how changes to hydrological and temperature regimes, atmospheric CO2 concentration, land use and the distribution of nonindigenous species can influence subsidy fluxes by affecting the biology and ecology of donor and recipient systems and the physical characteristics of stream-riparian boundaries. Climate-driven changes in the physiology and phenology of organisms with complex life cycles will influence their development time, body size and emergence patterns, with consequences for adjacent terrestrial consumers. Also, novel species interactions can modify subsidy dynamics via complex bottom-up and top-down effects. Given the seasonality and pulsed nature of subsidies, alterations of the temporal and spatial synchrony of resource availability to consumers across ecosystems are likely to result in ecological mismatches that can scale up from individual responses, to communities, to ecosystems. Similarly, altered hydrology, temperature, CO2 concentration and land use will modify the recruitment and quality of riparian vegetation, the timing of leaf abscission and the establishment of invasive riparian species. Along with morphological changes to stream-terrestrial boundaries, these will alter the use and fluxes of allochthonous subsidies associated with stream ecosystems. Future research should aim to understand how subsidy dynamics will be affected by key drivers of global change, including agricultural intensification, increasing water use and biotic homogenization. Our conceptual framework based on the match-mismatch between donor and recipient organisms may facilitate understanding of the multiple effects of global change and aid in the development of future research questions.",,,,,"Martí, Eugènia/J-9146-2012; Larsen, Stefano/A-5454-2016; Muehlbauer, Jeffrey/G-3607-2011","Larsen, Stefano/0000-0002-6774-1407; Muehlbauer, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1808-580X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JUL,2016,22,7,,,,,2489,2504,,10.1111/gcb.13182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13182,,,,,,,,26649817,,,,,WOS:000378722000017,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is not yet clear whether a front (thermal, salinity or chlorophyll) acts as an absolute barrier to fish migration on either side or its structure allows interaction of species with different physiological requirements. Our objective was to assess potential areas of overlap between cold- and warm-water species using probabilities of presence derived from fishery datasets and remotely sensed environment data in the Kuroshio-Oyashio region in the WNP. Fishery data comprised skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) fishing locations and proxy presences (derived from fishing night light images) for neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartrami) and Pacific saury (Cololabis saira). Monthly (August-November) satellite remotely sensed sea-surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and sea-surface height anomaly images were used as environment data. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models were used to determine probabilities of presence (PoP) for each set of fishery and environment data for the area 35-45 degrees N and 140-160 degrees E. Maps of both sets of PoPs were compared and areas of overlap identified using a combined probability map. Results indicated that areas of spatial overlap existed among the species habitats, which gradually widened from September to November. The reasons for these overlaps include the presence of strong thermal/ocean-color gradients between cold Oyashio and warm Kuroshio waters, and also the presence of the sub-arctic front. Due to the high abundance of food along frontal zones, the species use the fronts as foraging grounds while confining within physiologically tolerable waters on either side of the front. The interaction zone around the front points to areas that might be accessible to both species for foraging, which suggests intense prey-predator interaction zones. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we analyzed the monthly anomalies and looked for a relationship of such anomalies with total solar irradiance (TSI) and then the Regime Shift Detector (RSD) was applied to detect possible temperature regimes in the series. Afterwards, we calculated a yearly temperature range per pixel (amplitude of seasonal cycle) and through the subtraction of a latitudinal theoretical curve of temperature based on solar irradiance, the residuals of the seasonal cycle were obtained. The results showed an almost complete spatial synchrony and dominance of negative anomalies from 1950 to mid-late 1970's, with a switch to near-zero and positive anomalies that lasted up to late 1990's when a new shift to negative values was detected. Such a shift lasted until the early 2000's when positive anomalies appeared again but there was a change to negative anomalies in the late 2000's. These results were supported by the RSD. The TSI variability shows a clear relationship with that of sea surface temperature anomalies and with the regime changes. This is probably due to a difference in the amount of energy received from the sun. Comparing the cool regime versus the warm regime, the second one received 0.39% more energy (approximately 3x10(8) Jm(-2)) from the sun. Seasonal cycles show larger ranges at northern latitudes (>40 degrees N), northern tropical-temperate transition zone (20 degrees-26 degrees N) and in the tropical-equatorial band (0 degrees-30 degrees S).

The alfalfa weevil,Hypera postica(Gyllenhal), is an economically important pest of alfalfa throughout the western United States. Coccinellids and nabids are among the most important natural enemies of this species, contributing to the biological control ofH. posticain alfalfa fields. The spatio-temporal dynamics ofH. posticaand these two predator groups were investigated using 81 (= 9 x 9 grid) sample points in each of five alfalfa fields in north-central Montana. The data were analyzed using variogram and spatial analysis by distance indices (SADIE). RESULTS: Variogram analysis revealed the spatial dependence (aggregation) ofH. posticain 17 of 19 sampling times for larvae, and three of 12 sampling times for adults. Using SADIE, statistically significant aggregation distribution was evident in four of 19 sampling times for larvae, and five of 12 sampling times for adults ofH. postica. Combined variogram and SADIE showed strong evidence of spatial aggregation ofH. posticalarval population (similar to 95%) while a moderate level of aggregation in the adult population (similar to 67%) of the sampling times analyzed. The average aggregation distances based on the range value of the variogram were 22.3 m and 14.7 m for larvae and adults, respectively. Based on variogram results, populations of natural enemies, coccinellids andNabisspp. were found spatially aggregated in 57.9% and 5.6% of the sampling times, respectively. SADIE further supported the variogram results as coccinellid populations (52.6% of sampling times) were highly aggregated in contrast with theNabisspp. populations (5.6% of sampling times) in alfalfa fields. There was no evidence of significant spatial synchrony betweenH. posticaand its predators, coccinellids andNabisspp. CONCLUSION: Our study was able to determine the spatial and temporal distribution ofH. posticaand its two natural enemies (coccinellids and nabids) in irrigated alfalfa fields.

For forest tent caterpillar (FTC), independent studies do not converge on a singular conclusion, although all indicate that forest structure influences outbreak dynamics. These studies also vary in how they treat climate as a covariate. We evaluated the relative importance of host forest landscape composition and configuration, as well as climate, for their influence on FTC outbreak cycling in the twentieth century. We predicted that FTC outbreaks would exhibit greater synchrony and intensity within areas associated with higher abundance of host trees. We reconstructed FTC outbreaks from 1928 to 2006 using tree-ring analysis within a well-structured experimental landscape located in northwestern Ontario and northern Minnesota. Time-series clustering and spatial nonparametric covariance were used to determine whether similarities in time series and patterns in spatial synchrony corresponded with land management history. Using constrained ordination, we compared statistical properties of outbreak time series to landscape variables representing host abundance, forest configuration, and climate. We found no evidence of climatic effects at the scale of this study, but a significant albeit small influence of landscape structure on outbreak dynamics. Outbreaks were more synchronous and more cyclic within managed zones containing a greater relative abundance of aspen and other hardwood host tree species, compared with the more conifer-dominated Wilderness area. Yet, we also observed asynchronous outbreak dynamics across the study area, such that correlations with slower-changing forest landscape variables varied starkly among outbreak pulses. Consequently, the strength of relationship between landscape variables and FTC outbreak patterns varied strongly through time-a result that may explain why short-term studies yield conclusions that are at odds with one another. Our results speak to the importance of long time series, contrasting landscape structure, use of multivariate methods, and controlling for climatic variation when investigating the effects of forest landscape structure on the cyclic-eruptive spatial dynamics for forest defoliators.",,,,,"Sturtevant, Brian/KHV-0383-2024; Townsend, Philip/B-5741-2008","James, Patrick/0000-0001-7639-7217; Sturtevant, Brian/0000-0003-0965-6260; Cooke, Barry/0000-0002-8347-9832; Robert, Louis-Etienne/0000-0002-4406-4079; Townsend, Philip/0000-0001-7003-8774; Kneeshaw, Daniel/0000-0003-2585-8436",,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,AUG,2020,11,8,,,,,,,e03096,10.1002/ecs2.3096,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3096,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000567504400012,View Full Record in Web of Science

New methods enable tracking spatial regime boundaries via vegetation landcover data, and this approach is being used for strategic management across biomes. A clear advancement would be incorporating animal community data to track spatial regime boundaries alongside vegetation data. In a 41,170-hectare grassland experiencing woody plant encroachment, we test the utility of using animal community data to track spatial regimes via two hypotheses. (H1) Spatial regime boundaries identified via independent vegetation and animal datasets will exhibit spatial synchrony; specifically, grassland:woodland bird community boundaries will synchronize with grass:woody vegetation boundaries. (H2) Negative feedbacks will stabilize spatial regimes identified via animal data; specifically, frequent fire treatments will stabilize grassland bird community boundaries. We used 26 years of bird community and vegetation data alongside 32 years of fire history data. We identified spatial regime boundaries with bird community data via a wombling approach. We identified spatial regime boundaries with vegetation data by calculating spatial covariance between remotely-sensed grass and woody plant cover per pixel. For fire history data, we calculated the cumulative number of fires per pixel. Setting bird boundary strength (wombling R-2 values) as the response variable, we tested our hypotheses with a hierarchical generalized additive model (HGAM). Both hypotheses were supported: animal boundaries synchronized with vegetation boundaries in space and time, and grassland bird communities stabilized as fire frequency increased (HGAM explained 38% of deviance). We can now track spatial regimes via animal community data pixel-by-pixel and year-by-year. Alongside vegetation boundary tracking, tracking animal community boundaries can inform the scale of management necessary to maintain animal communities endemic to desirable ecological states.

In common voles, however, it has been suggested by Turchin (2003) that some populations exhibit first-order cycles, resulting from strong overcompensation (i.e. carrying capacity overshoots in peak years, with only an effect of the current year abundance on annual growth rates). We focus on a common vole (Microtus arvalis) population from western France that exhibits 3-year cycles. Several overcompensating nonlinear models for populations dynamics are fitted to the data, notably those of Hassell, and Maynard-Smith and Slatkin. Overcompensating direct density dependence (DD) provides a satisfactory description of winter crashes, and one-year delayed density dependence is not responsible for the crashes, thus these are not classical second-order cycles. A phase-driven modulation of direct density dependence maintains a low-phase, explaining why the cycles last three years instead of two. Our analyses suggest that some of this phase dependence can be expressed as one-year delayed DD, but phase dependence provides a better description. Hence, modelling suggests that cycles in this population are first-order cycles with a low phase after peaks, rather than fully second-order cycles. However, based on the popular log-linear second-order autoregressive model, we would conclude only that negative delayed density dependence exists. The additive structure of this model cannot show when delayed DD occurs (here, during lows rather than peaks). Our analyses thus call into question the automated use of second-order log-linear models, and suggests that more attention should be given to non-(log)linear models when studying cyclic populations. From a biological viewpoint, the fast crashes through overcompensation that we found suggest they might be caused by parasites or food rather than predators, though predators might have a role in maintaining the low phase and spatial synchrony.",,,,,"Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014; Barraquand, Frederic/G-1599-2011","Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Barraquand, Frederic/0000-0002-4759-0269",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,NOV,2014,83,6,,,,,1367,1378,,10.1111/1365-2656.12257,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12257,,,,,,,,24905436,,,,,WOS:000344339500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

B.",,,Seasonal temperature and precipitation regulate brook trout young-of-the-year abundance and population dynamics,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Abundance of the young-of-the-year (YOY) fish can vary greatly among years and it may be driven by several key biological processes (i.e. adult spawning, egg survival and fry survival) that span several months. However, the relative influence of seasonal weather patterns on YOY abundance is poorly understood. 2. We assessed the importance of seasonal air temperature (a surrogate for stream temperature) and precipitation (a surrogate for stream flow) on brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) YOY summer abundance using a 29-year data set from 115 sites in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, U.S.A. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model that allowed the effect of seasonal weather covariates to vary among sites and accounted for imperfect detection of individuals. 3. Summer YOY abundance was affected by preceding seasonal air temperature and precipitation, and these regional-scale drivers led to spatial synchrony in YOY abundance dynamics across the 170-km-long study area. Mean winter precipitation had the greatest effect on YOY abundance and the relationship was negative. Mean autumn precipitation, and winter and spring temperature had significantly positive effects on YOY abundance, and mean autumn temperature had a significant negative effect. In addition, the effect of summer precipitation differed along a latitudinal gradient, with YOY abundance at more northern sites being more responsive to inter-annual variation in summer precipitation. 4. Strong YOY years resulted in high abundance of adults (>age 1 + fish) in the subsequent year at more than half of sites. However, higher adult abundance did not result in higher YOY abundance in the subsequent year at any of the study sites (i.e. no positive stock-recruitment relationship). 5. Our results indicate that YOY abundance is a key driver of brook trout population dynamics that is mediated by seasonal weather patterns. A reliable assessment of climate change impacts on brook trout needs to account for how alternations in seasonal weather patterns impact YOY abundance and how such relationships may differ across the range of brook trout distribution.",,,,,"Hocking, Daniel/O-3658-2018; Hitt, Nathaniel/Y-6541-2019; Hocking, Daniel/C-5701-2013","Hocking, Daniel/0000-0003-1889-9184",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,JAN,2016,61,1,,,,,88,99,,10.1111/fwb.12682,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12682,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000368034300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

First published January 16, 2013; doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.00189.2012.-In renal proximal tubule (PT) cells, sodium-phosphate cotransporter IIa (NaPiIIa) is normally concentrated within the apical membrane where it reabsorbs similar to 70% of luminal phosphate (Pi). NaPiIIa activity is acutely regulated by moderating its abundance within the apical membrane. Under low-Pi conditions, NaPiIIa is retained within the apical membrane. Under high-Pi conditions, NaPiIIa is retrieved from the apical membrane and trafficked to the lysosomes for degradation. The present study investigates the role of Shank2 in regulating the distribution of NaPiIIa. In opossum kidney cells, a PT cell model, knockdown of Shank2 in cells maintained in low-Pi media resulted in a marked decrease in NaPiIIa abundance. After being transferred into high-Pi media, live-cell imaging showed that mRFP-Shank2E and GFP-NaPiIIa underwent endocytosis and trafficked together through the subapical domain. Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy demonstrated that GFP-NaPiIIa and mRFP-Shank2 have indistinguishable diffusion coefficients and migrated through the subapical domain in temporal synchrony. Raster image cross-correlation spectroscopy demonstrated these two proteins course through the subapical domain in temporal-spatial synchrony. In the microvilli of cells under low-Pi conditions and in the subapical domain of cells under high-Pi conditions, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-Forster resonance energy transfer analysis of Cer-NaPiIIa and EYFP-Shank2E found these fluors reside within 10 nm of each other.

We performed a field experiment to investigate how the movement of a delphacid planthopper (Prokelisia crocea) among discrete patches of prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata) is affected by the composition of the matrix (mudflat, native nonhost grasses, and the introduced grass smooth brome [Bromus inermis]). Within each matrix type, marked planthoppers were released onto experimental cordgrass patches that were made identical in size, isolation, and host plant quality. We found that the emigration rate (planthoppers lost per patch per day) was 1.3 times higher for patches embedded in the two nonhost grass matrix types than for patches in mudflat. The rate of immigration (immigrants per patch per day) into patches isolated by 3 m was 5.4 times higher in the brome than in the mudflat matrix. Patches in the native grass matrix had intermediate immigration rates. In addition, a survey of planthopper distributions in nature revealed that both the within- and among-patch distributions of the planthopper were related to the composition of the matrix. Within patches, individuals accumulated against mudflat edges (relative to patch interiors) but not against nonhost grass edges. Among patches, incidence and density increased with the proportion of the matrix composed of open mud. The matrix was equal to that of patch geography (size and isolation) in its ability to explain the distribution of the planthopper. We suggest that the low permeability of the mudflat relative to a nonhost grass edge may explain these planthopper distributional patterns. Also, because natural cordgrass patches in mudflat were richer in nutrients than those in nonhost grasses, planthoppers may have been more likely to remain and build up densities on the former patches. We predict that the displacement of native matrix types by invasive brome will result in increased connectivity and greater spatial synchrony in densities of planthoppers among cordgrass patches.",,,,,"Cronin, James/V-2781-2019; Haynes, Kyle/C-1374-2012","Haynes, Kyle/0000-0002-3283-6633",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,NOV,2003,84,11,,,,,2856,2866,,10.1890/02-0611,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-0611,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000187363200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

A 30-y time-series of very high resolution false colour aerial photographs was studied for eight saltmarsh sites in the Westerschelde estuary (southwest Netherlands). Detailed maps of vegetation cover were produced for each year, based on a supervised classification, and changes in vegetation cover were analysed in a geographical information system. The results of the vegetation change maps and complementary series of topographic surveys have shown evidence of saltmarsh cycles, but without spatial synchrony in these cycles for the Westerschelde. For each saltmarsh, a different status of net erosion or accretion was found. Within each saltmarsh, there were both areas with vegetation loss and with vegetation expansion in each period. Most saltmarshes showed a simultaneous expansion of Spartina anglica by tussock growth, and a lateral retreat of the saltmarsh plateau through undercutting of a cliff at the edge of this plateau, resulting in saltmarsh rejuvenation. The rate of lateral retreat of the saltmarsh plateau decreased with the establishment of pioneer vegetation in front of the cliff (probably through dissipation of wave and tidal energy caused by the friction associated with the pioneer vegetation), and was generally not related to the frequency of high magnitude tides and high magnitude onshore winds. For the saltmarsh site that showed severe lateral erosion, a relationship with the mudflat topography was found, with lateral retreat of the saltmarsh plateau being compensated by an increase in mudflat elevation, eventually slowing down the erosion rate, and facilitating the subsequent expansion of pioneer vegetation in front of the cliff. The study demonstrates the significance of intrinsic processes in saltmarsh development, and the necessity to consider the local feedback mechanisms between plant growth, morphology and hydrodynamics of both the saltmarsh and the mudflat, when assessing the status of saltmarshes. It also shows the importance of assessing the changes in saltmarsh area in a spatial context, rather than looking at changes in total area of saltmarsh vegetation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Uncertainty regarding the relative importance of mortality operating at different spatial scales hinders the prioritization of science and management activities. We therefore examined spatial and temporal coherence in smolt survivals for Coho Salmon based on a decision tree framework organized by spatial hierarchy. Smolt survival patterns of populations that entered marine waters within the Salish Sea were analyzed and compared with Pacific coast reference populations at similar latitudes. In all areas, wild Coho Salmon had higher survival than hatchery Coho Salmon. Coherence in Coho Salmon smolt survival occurred at multiple spatial scales during ocean entry years 1977-2010. The primary pattern within the Salish Sea was a declining smolt survival trend over this period. In comparison, smolt survival of Pacific coast reference populations was low in the 1990s but subsequently increased. Within the Salish Sea, smolt survival in the Strait of Georgia declined faster than it did in Puget Sound. Spatial synchrony was stronger among neighboring Salish Sea populations and occurred at a broader spatial scale immediately following the 1989 ecosystem regime shift in the North Pacific Ocean than before or after. Smolt survival of Coho Salmon was synchronized at a more local scale than reported by other researchers for Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha, Pink Salmon O. gorbuscha, Chum Salmon O. keta, and Sockeye Salmon O. nerka, suggesting that early marine conditions are especially important for Coho Salmon in the Salish Sea. Further exploration of ecosystem variables at multiple spatial scales is needed to effectively address linkages between the marine ecosystem and Coho Salmon smolt survival within the Salish Sea.

There is increasing evidence that overwinter climate can influence biogeochemical cycling belowground, perhaps by disrupting this synchrony. In this study, we experimentally reduced snow accumulation in northern hardwood forest plots to examine the effects of soil freezing on the dynamics of fine roots (< 1 mm diameter) measured using minirhizotrons. Snow removal treatment during the relatively mild winters of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 induced mild freezing temperatures (to -4 degreesC) lasting approximately three months at shallow soil depths (to -30 cm) in sugar maple and yellow birch stands. This treatment resulted in elevated overwinter fine root mortality in treated compared to reference plots of both species, and led to an earlier peak in fine root production during the subsequent growing season. These shifts in fine root dynamics increased fine root turnover but were not large enough to significantly alter fine root biomass. No differences in morality response were found between species. Laboratory tests on potted tree seedlings exposed to controlled freezing regimes confirmed that mild freezing temperatures (to -5 degreesC) were insufficient to directly injure winter-hardened fine roots of these species, suggesting that the marked response recorded in our forest plots was caused indirectly by mechanical damage to roots in frozen soil. Elevated fine root necromass in treated plots decomposed quickly, and may have contributed an excess flux of about 0.5 g N/m(2).yr, which is substantial relative to measurements of N fluxes from these plots. Our results suggest elevated overwinter mortality temporarily reduced fine root length in treatment plots and reduced plant uptake, thereby disrupting the temporal synchrony between nutrient availability and uptake and enhancing rates of nitrification. Increased frequency of soil freezing events, as may occur with global change, could alter fine root dynamics within the northern hardwood forest disrupting the normally tight coupling between nutrient mineralization and uptake.",,,,,"; Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014","Groffman, Peter/0000-0001-8371-6255; Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-2563,1573-515X,,,,NOV,2001,56,2,,,,,175,190,,10.1023/A:1013072519889,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013072519889,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000172448100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Graham & Lambin (2002) have reported on a weasel-reduction experiment, concluding that the impact of weasel predation on field vole survival was neither sufficient nor necessary to initiate and drive the cyclic decline of field vole populations in Kielder Forest, northern England. They also stated that their findings contradict conclusively the specialist predator hypothesis put forward to explain population cycles of voles in North Europe. 2. Straightforward inferences from Kielder Forest to the northern boreal zone are misleading, because the population cycles of voles in Kielder Forest differ essentially from North European vole cycles. The low amplitude of the vole cycles in Kielder Forest, their restricted spatial synchrony in comparison to northern Europe and the virtual lack of interspecific synchrony in Kielder Forest suggest that there are essential differences between the mechanisms responsible for the two types of cyclic fluctuations of voles. 3. The weasel-reduction experiment may provide a misleading picture on the role of predators, even in the Kielder Forest cycle. The experimental reduction of weasels alone may not stop the population decline of voles, because competing larger predators are expected to increase their hunting in the weasel-reduction areas. The small spatial scale of the experiment, which produced only slight, short-term differences in weasel densities between reduction and control areas, also suggests that other predators could have compensated easily for the weasels that were removed. 4. We propose a new version of the predation hypothesis to explain low-amplitude population cycles of voles in temperate Europe, including the Kielder Forest. The interaction between generalist predators and vole populations might account for these cycles because generalists can have a functional response that is destabilizing in the neighbourhood of the equilibrium point. As most generalists are orders of magnitude larger than weasels, and thus need much more food for survival, generalist-driven cycles should be characterized by high prey minima, as observed in Kielder Forest.",,,,,"Korpimäki, Erkki/JED-5831-2023; Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013; Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043; Banks, Peter/0000-0002-4340-6495; Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,NOV,2005,74,6,,,,,1150,1159,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.01015.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.01015.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000232995200016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Changes in the belt of three coastal biogeographical provinces (V-EK) show significant correlations with those in three inland provinces (St-ES). Furthermore, positive trends in these belts are reflected as new provincial finds north of them. The spatial synchrony is supposedly caused by spatially correlated climatic conditions. This is supported by evidence of synchronous trends in species grouped according to their overwintering stages (Marttila 1991, Bruun 1992). The increased migration rate, indicated by the new provincial finds, is probably a consequence of high population densities, and does not explain the synchrony itself. Kaisila's division into expansive and fluctuant species is considered to be a historical rather than a biological characterization. During the 19th century, the reporting of new lepidopteran species was delayed by about 50 years if they were night-active vs. day-active. The low numbers of observers and slow development of collecting methods have caused further analytical uncertainties. Some of Kaisila's expansive species may actually have been inhabitants of Finland for long periods of time. At present, drainage of peatlands and overgrowth of meadows are the most adverse environmental changes causing a decline of lepidopterans, particularly of the butterflies. Increase of bushiness and reeds appear to have positively affected many geometrid and noctuid species. The high incidence of new provincial finds and of species new to the country in the 1990s as well as positive trends in late-autumn and early-spring species supposedly reflect the ongoing climatic change. The Finnish lepidopteran fauna is undergoing a dynamic phase: around 30 recent invaders and 40 older expansive species are spreading, while fewer are retreating; the declining species are mainly habitat specialists while the expansive ones are generalists, mainly feeding on bushes and trees.

Masting events of trees (i.e. the intermittent and synchronous production of abundant seeding material) is an extreme example of such fluctuations. Our objective was to establish the degree of spatial and temporal synchrony in common four masting tree species in boreal Finland and account for potential causal drivers of these patterns. Methods We investigated the spatial intraspecific and temporal interspecific fluctuations in annual seed production of four tree species in Finland, silver birch Betula pendula Roth, downy birch Betula pubescens Ehrh., Norway spruce Picea abies (L.) H.Karst. and rowanberry Sorbus aucuparia L. We also tested to see whether variations in seed production were linked to annual weather conditions. Seeding abundance data were derived from tens of stands per species across large spatial scales within Finland during 1979 to 2014 (for rowanberries only 1986 to 2014). Important Findings All species showed spatial synchrony in seed production at scales up to 1000 km. Annual estimates of seed production were strongly correlated between species. Spring and summer temperatures explained most variation in crop sizes of tree species with 0-to 2-year time lags, whereas rainfall had relatively little influence. Warm weather during flowering (May temperature) in the flowering year (Year t) and 2 years before (t-2) were correlated with seed production. However, high May temperatures during the previous year (t-1) adversely affected seed production. Summer temperatures in Year t-1 was positively correlated with seed production, likely because this parameter enhances the development of flower primordials, but the effect was negative with a time lag of 2 years. The negative feedback in temperature coefficients is also likely due to patterns of resource allocation, as abundant flowering and seed production in these species is thought to reduce the subsequent initiation of potential new flower buds. Since the most important weather variables also showed spatial correlation up to 1000 km, weather parameters likely explain much of the spatial and temporal synchrony in seed production of these four studied tree species.",,,,,"Lehikoinen, Aleksi/O-5444-2016; Gallego-Zamorano, Juan/R-2034-2018","Lehikoinen, Aleksi/0000-0002-1989-277X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1752-9921,1752-993X,,,,APR,2018,11,2,,,,,180,188,,10.1093/jpe/rtw117,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtw117,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000427134100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Twenty-two seasonal samples of the bogue Boops boops (Teleostei: Sparidae) were collected at seven localities along a coastal positional gradient from the northern North-East Atlantic to the northern Mediterranean coast of Spain. We used our own, taxonomically consistent, data on parasite communities. The variations in parasite composition and structure with geographical and regional distance were examined at two spatial scales, namely local parasite faunas and component communities, using both presence-absence (neighbour joining distance) and abundance (Mahalanobis distance) data. The influence of geographical and regional distance on faunal/community divergence was assessed through the permutation of distance matrices. Our results revealed that: (1) geographical and regional distances do not affect the species composition in the system under study at the higher scales; (2) geographical distance between localities contributes significantly to the decay of similarity estimated from parasite abundance at the lowest scale (i.e. the individual host); (3) the structured spatial patterns are consistent in time but not across seasons; and (4) a restricted clade of species (the 'core' species of the bogue parasite fauna) contributes substantially to the observed patterns of both community homogenization and differentiation owing to the strong relationship between local abundance and regional distribution of species. The main factors that tend to homogenize the composition of parasite communities of bogue at higher regional scales are related to the dispersal of parasite colonizers across host populations, which we denote as horizontal neighbourhood colonization. In contrast, the spatial structure detectable in quantitative comparisons only, is related to a vertical neighbourhood colonization associated with larval dispersal on a local level. The stronger decline with distance in the spatial synchrony of the assemblages of the 'core' species indicates a close-echoing environmental synchrony that declines with distance.

According to the specialist predator hypothesis, reciprocal interactions between voles and small predators that specialize on voles, such as weasels, can cause multiannual cycles. A fundamental feature of classical weasel-vole models is a long time-lag in the numerical response of the predator to variations in prey abundance: weasel abundance increases with that of voles and peaks approximately 1 yr later. We investigated the numerical response of the common weasel (Mustela nivalis) to fluctuating abundances of common voles (Microtus arvalis) in recently colonized agrosteppes of Castilla-y-Leon, northwestern Spain, at the southern limit of the species' range. Populations of both weasels and voles exhibited multiannual cycles with a 3-yr period. Weasels responded quickly and numerically to changes in common-vole abundance, with a time lag between prey and weasel abundance that did not exceed 4 months and occurred during the breeding season, reflecting the quick conversion of prey into predator offspring and/or immigration to sites with high vole populations. We found no evidence of a sustained, high weasel abundance following vole abundance peaks. Weasel population growth rates showed spatial synchrony across study sites approximately 60 km apart. Weasel dynamics were more synchronized with that of common voles than with other prey species (mice or shrews). However, asynchrony within, as well as among sites, in the abundance of voles and alternative prey suggests that weasel mobility could allow them to avoid starvation during low-vole phases, precluding the emergence of prolonged time lag in the numerical response to voles. Our observations are inconsistent with the specialist predator hypothesis as currently formulated, and suggest that weasels might follow rather than cause the vole cycles in northwestern Spain. The reliance of a specialized predator on a functional group of prey such as small rodents does not necessarily lead to a long delay in the numerical response by the predator, depending on the spatial and interspecific synchrony in prey dynamics.",,,,,"Mougeot, Francois/Y-9569-2019; Luque-Larena, Juan Jose/D-6454-2014; Mougeot, Francois/B-1894-2009; Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth/E-7922-2016; Lambin, Xavier/E-8284-2011","Luque-Larena, Juan Jose/0000-0001-6425-637X; Mougeot, Francois/0000-0002-5819-6275; Rodriguez-Pastor, Ruth/0000-0001-8435-6386; Lambin, Xavier/0000-0003-4643-2653",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,SEP,2019,100,9,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.2776,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2776,,AUG 2019,,,,,,31172505,,,,,WOS:000482325300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The differences can arise if the areas are subject to different climatic forcing or if they are relatively isolated from each other due to topographic and ocean circulation features which inhibit advective inputs of water mass properties. Local differences in hydrographic conditions can therefore potentially limit the applicability of existing long time series of coastally monitored temperatures for addressing questions at large spatial scales, such as the response of species distributions and phenologies to climate change. In this study we investigate the spatial synchrony of long-term sea surface temperatures in the North Sea-Baltic Sea region as measured daily at four coastal sites (Marsdiep, Netherlands; Torungen, Norway; Skagens Reef, Denmark; and Christianso, Denmark) and in several large offshore areas. All time series, including two series reconstructed and intercalibrated for this study (Skagens Reef and Christianso, Denmark), began during 1861-1880 and continue until at least 2001. Temperatures at coastal sites co-varied strongly with each other and with opportunistically measured offshore temperatures despite separation distances between measuring locations of 20-1200 km. This covariance is probably due to the influence of large-scale atmospheric processes on regional temperatures and is consistent with the known correlation radius of atmospheric fluctuations (ca. 1000 km). Differences (e. g, long-term trends, amplitude of seasonal variations) between coastal temperatures and those measured in adjacent offshore areas varied nonrandomly over time and were often significantly autocorrelated up to 2 years. These differences suggest that spatial variations in physical oceanographic phenomena and sampling heterogeneities associated with opportunistic sampling could affect perceptions of biological responses to temperature fluctuations. The documentation that the coastally measured temperatures co-vary with those measured opportunistically in offshore areas suggests that the coastal data, which have been measured daily using standardized methods and instruments, contain much of the variability seen at larger spatial scales. We conclude that both types of time series can facilitate assessments of how species and ecosystems have responded to past temperature changes and how they may react to future temperature changes.

We report the role of dispersal in the metapopulation dynamics of a protist predator-prey pair, the predaceous ciliate Didinium nasutum Muller feeding on the bacterivorous ciliate Colpidium cf. striatum Stokes. In previous work we showed that this extinction-prone pair persisted as metapopulations in subdivided habitats. 2. An experiment assessed the effects of habitat subdivision on persistence and dynamics. Undivided habitats were 270 or 750 mL in volume, and subdivided habitats (arrays) were sets of nine or 25 linked 30 mL bottles (270 or 750 mL total volume), each replicated three times. Undivided microcosms allowed maximum dispersal, whereas subdivision reduced dispersal. Within arrays, bottles with more connecting tubes allowed more dispersal. Nine and 25 bottle arrays also differed in the mean number of connections per bottle. The effects of dispersal on predator-prey dynamics were tested by comparing subdivided vs. undivided microcosms, bottles with different numbers of connecting tubes, and nine vs. 25 bottle arrays. 3. We tested the following predictions from metapopulation theory. (i) Predator and prey persistence and predator abundance will be greatest at intermediate dispersal rates. (ii) Prey abundance, local population variability and asynchrony in population fluctuations will be greatest at low dispersal rates. (iii) Predator:prey ratios will be greatest at high dispersal rates. 4. Predictions were confirmed, except for the following. (i) Two measures of synchrony differed in whether they showed the expected pattern. Spatial synchrony (estimated via correlation of densities among patches within sampling dates) showed high variance and did not vary with dispersal rates. However, spatial variability (CV of density across adjacent pairs of linked bottles), showed the predicted decrease with increased dispersal. (ii) Evidence that dispersal increases predator:prey ratios was inconclusive. Predator:prey ratios were lower in undivided 750 mL microcosms than in 750 mL arrays, possibly because predators over-exploited prey in undivided microcosms, so that both became scarce. Conversely, within arrays, predator:prey ratios were greatest in bottles that allowed the most dispersal, as predicted. 5. This work generally confirms the predicted effects of dispersal on predator-prey metapopulation dynamics. It also demonstrates the need for models to include more realism, e.g. the possibility of over-exploitation with very high dispersal.",,,,,"Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009","Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,,,,,SEP,1996,65,5,,,,,640,652,,10.2307/5743,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/5743,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VK05700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, replicated studies of community assembly at whole-ecosystem scales are rare. Here, we describe a series of whole-lake experiments, in which the recovery of zooplankton communities was tracked following an ecosystem-scale disturbance, that is, application of the piscicide, rotenone. Using a before-after-control-impact design, 14 lakes in eastern Washington were studied: Seven lakes were treated with rotenone, while seven lakes acted as reference systems. Each lake was monitored up to 6 months before and 1-2 years after the rotenone treatments. Zooplankton samples and environmental measurements were collected approximately monthly from each lake. Community responses following disturbance were assessed using metrics of abundance, diversity, and community composition, as well as taxonomic group abundance. Zooplankton recovery was also assessed using species traits related to habitat, feeding mode, trophic level, body size, and life history. In addition to patterns of recovery, potential mechanisms were explored relating to abiotic conditions, biotic interactions, and traits. There were steep declines in the abundance (average across years: 99%) and diversity (average across years: 75%) of the zooplankton community following rotenone treatment. Although abundance had recovered by the second year of the study, community diversity had not fully recovered after 2 years. Communities from rotenone lakes appeared to be compositionally recovered within about 8 months following disturbance. Cyclopoid copepods were typically the first group to recover and remained dominant for a few months, whereas cladocerans recovered more slowly, typically within similar to 6-7 months following rotenone. Calanoid copepods were not fully recovered 2 years after rotenone treatment. Traits related to body size and feeding mode were associated with the zooplankton communities following rotenone treatment. We failed to observe significant spatial synchrony in recovery patterns of zooplankton across lakes, though we did observe significant synchrony of zooplankton taxonomic groups within lakes. These findings suggest that traits related to ecological function, and to a lesser extent, biotic, and abiotic factors, as well as characteristics of the disturbance itself, may be important in helping to understand recovery processes.",,,,,"Strecker, Angela/GWC-1818-2022; Strecker, Angela/E-9430-2016","Strecker, Angela/0000-0001-9387-1654",,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,APR,2022,13,4,,,,,,,e3983,10.1002/ecs2.3983,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3983,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000777973200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim was to determine the relative importance of different factors affecting the observed temporal patterns of population dynamics and their spatial correlations. A wide range of population dynamics was observed (downward or upward trends, cycles, local extinctions and recolonizations), but overall the populations were not self-replacing (lambda < 1). Many quadrats remained unoccupied throughout the study period, but a few were occupied at high densities for all 10 years. Most quadrats showed transient oilseed rape populations, lasting 1-4 years. There were strong spatial patterns in mean population density, associated with soil conditions and the successional age of the plant community dominating the verge, and these large-scale spatial patterns were highly consistent from year to year. The importance of seed spilled from trucks in transit to the processing plant at Erith in Kent was confirmed: rape populations were significantly higher on the 'to Erith' verge than the 'from Erith' verge (overall mean 2.83-fold greater stem density). Quadrats in which lambda > 1 were much more frequent in the 'to Erith' verge, indicating that seed immigration can give the spurious impression of self-replacing population dynamics in time-series analysis. There was little evidence of a pervasive Moran effect, and climatic forcing did not produce widespread large-scale synchrony in population dynamics for the motorway as a whole; just 23% of quadrats had significant rank correlations with the mean time-series. There was, however, significant local spatial synchrony of population dynamics, apparently associated with soil disturbance and seed input. This study draws attention to the possibility that different processes may impose population synchrony at different scales. We hypothesize that synchrony in this system is driven by at least three processes: small-scale, local forcing caused by soil disturbance, intermediate-scale forcing as a result of seed input, and large-scale climatic forcing (e.g. winter rainfall) that affects the motorway as a whole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,SEP 22,2004,271,1551,,,,,1909,1916,,10.1098/rspb.2004.2814,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2004.2814,,,,,,,,15347513,,,,,WOS:000223916200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this region grows Polylepis tarapacana, a long-lived tree species that is very sensitive to hydroclimatic changes and has been widely used for tree-ring studies in the central and southern Altiplano. However, in the northern sector of the Peruvian and Chilean Altiplano (16-19 S) still exists a gap of high-resolution hydroclimatic data based on tree-ring records. Our study provides an overview of the temporal evolution of the late-spring-mid-summer precipitation for the period 1625-2013 CE at the northern South American Altiplano, allowing for the identification of wet or dry periods based on a regional reconstruction from three P. tarapacana chronologies. An increase in the occurrence of extreme dry events, together with a decreasing trend in the reconstructed precipitation, has been recorded since the 1970s in the northern Altiplano within the context of the last similar to 4 centuries. The average precipitation over the last 17 years stands out as the driest in our 389-year reconstruction. We reveal a temporal and spatial synchrony across the Altiplano region of dry conditions since the mid-1970s. Independent tree-ring-based hydroclimate reconstructions and several paleoclimatic records based on other proxies available for the tropical Andes record this synchrony. The influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the northern Altiplano precipitation was detected by our rainfall reconstruction that showed past drier conditions in our study region associated with ENSO warm events. The spectral properties of the rainfall reconstruction showed strong imprints of ENSO variability at decadal, sub-decadal, and inter-annual timescales, in particular from the Pacific NINO 3 sector. Overall, the recent reduction in precipitation in comparison with previous centuries, the increase in extreme dry events and the coupling between precipitation and ENSO variability reported by this work is essential information in the context of the growing demand for water resources in the Altiplano.

Although from the management perspective information on beetle emergence is crucial in determining an appropriate timing to monitor beetle populations and mitigate outbreaks, especially at the landscape scale in a changing climate, no attempt has yet been made to map the spatiotemporal patterns of beetle emergence across the landscape. In this study, we used a novel heating cycle approach to map potential beetle emergence spatially and temporally. This study reveals that the thermal environment and timing for potential beetle emergence are spatially and temporally synchronous across the landscape. The spatial synchrony in potential beetle emergence occurs at a distance of more than 1500 km across the BC landscape. The spatiotemporal patterns of potential beetle emergence vary with the defined factors (region, period, latitude, elevation, and landform type). At the provincial and regional levels, the thermal environment for potential beetle emergence is surprisingly warmer during 1977-1987 compared to 1999-2010 except for the Southeast region although the provincial climate and weather are generally warmer during 1999-2010 than during 1977-1987, suggesting a small increase in annual temperature may not be enough to significantly improve the thermal environment. A warmer thermal environment with a larger temporal window for potential beetle emergence (i.e., the potential emergence starts earlier and ends later) is associated with the Southeast region, lower latitude and elevation, and landscape topographic features of canyons and valleys. However, although the thermal environment varies with the defined factors, the timing and window of potential beetle peak emergence remain consistent among these defined factors, suggesting that beetles may take different strategies to adapt to temporally synchronized thermal windows in the regions and areas with varied thermal environments. The summarized variables of heating cycles are limited in generally predicting the beetle infestations for a specific period, especially at endemic and incipient levels. However, they may play a greater role in predicting more severely infested areas. The heating cycle approach demonstrated in this study may provide a simple complementary tool to the existing climate suitability models in assessing the impacts of climate change on beetle outbreaks, particularly for those bark beetle species whose physiological responses to temperature have not been fully studied.

D.",,,Simulating the response of a threatened amphibian to climate-induced reductions in breeding habitat,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"ContextAmphibians are declining worldwide due to disease, invasive species, and habitat loss. Climate change may exacerbate habitat loss by altering the availability or suitability of aquatic breeding habitat through changes in precipitation, temperature, and the biophysical factors they influence. Measuring biological vital rates and the environmental covariates that affect them are crucial to understanding amphibian responses to a changing climate. However, doing so can be difficult due to access constraints, funding limitations, and difficulty of measuring spatially structured populations at landscape scales. Simulation-based approaches may provide reliable approximations of amphibian responses to changing environmental conditions.ObjectivesIn this study, we constructed a spatially explicit individual based model to simulate the response of the Arizona treefrog (Hyla wrightorum), a species of conservation concern, to reductions in breeding habitat availability. The Arizona treefrog metapopulation in the Huachuca Mountains and Canelo Hills of Arizona is known to breed at fewer than 20 breeding ponds that may become unsuitable due to climate change-induced shifts in hydroperiod, increased rates of invasion by non-native predators, or filling by sedimentation.MethodsWe simulated Arizona treefrog response to bioclimatically realistic scenarios that included reduced breeding habitat availability, failed recruitment, and a combination of both. Simulations included variable landscape configuration through space and time that were informed by an empirical hydroperiod dataset.ResultsWe found that climate-driven reductions in breeding habitat alone resulted in mean population declines of nearly 65%, even when reductions targeted the ponds least likely to fill with water. However, scenarios with concurrent breeding habitat loss and recruitment failure or very high recruitment failure resulted in 79% and 83% population declines, respectively. Reduced breeding habitat also increased spatial synchrony of occupancy through time and among simulations, pointing to a potential transition from a metapopulation to multiple isolated populations.ConclusionsIn the face of anthropogenically driven climate change and continually emerging management challenges, individual-based models provide a useful, mechanistic tool to explore how a combination of biological and environmental factors may interact to influence the future of species of conservation concern. We found evidence of a potential transition to isolated populations that may lead to limited functional connectivity and an increased risk of regional extinction for this species of conservation concern. Sensitivity analyses suggest our model was robust to uncertainty in model parameters and point to the critical role of dispersal in maintaining demographic and landscape connectivity among spatiotemporally heterogeneous habitat. A spatially explicit approach also enabled identification of specific habitat patches that may be less sensitive to climate change as well as those that may require more intensive management to conserve key populations or preserve metapopulation dynamics.",,,,,"Olden, Julian/A-8535-2010","Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187; Lawler, Joshua/0000-0002-8306-3175; Drake, Joseph/0000-0003-0458-3533; Mims, Meryl/0000-0003-0570-988X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0921-2973,1572-9761,,,,APR,2023,38,4,,,,,1051,1068,,10.1007/s10980-023-01599-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-023-01599-w,,FEB 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000931837000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we investigate oscillatory changes in infant fNIRS signals by using the oscillator decompisition method (OSC-DECOMP), which is a statistical method for extracting oscillators from time series data based on Gaussian linear state space models. OSC-DECOMP provides a natural decomposition of fNIRS data into oscillation components in a data-driven manner and does not require the arbitrary selection of band-pass filters. We analyzed 18-ch fNIRS data (3 minutes) acquired from 21 sleeping 3-month-old infants. Five to seven oscillators were extracted on most channels, and their frequency distribution had three peaks in the vicinity of 0.01-0.1 Hz, 1.6-2.4 Hz and 3.6-4.4 Hz. The first peak was considered to reflect hemodynamic changes in response to the brain activity, and the phase difference between oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb for the associated oscillators was at approximately 230 degrees. The second peak was attributed to cardiac pulse waves and mirroring noise. Although these oscillators have close frequencies, OSC-DECOMP can separate them through estimating their different projection patterns on oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb. The third peak was regarded as the harmonic of the second peak. By comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of two state space models, we determined that the time series of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb on each channel originate from common oscillatory activity. We also utilized the result of OSC-DECOMP to investigate the frequency-specific functional connectivity. Whereas the brain oscillator exhibited functional connectivity, the pulse waves and mirroring noise oscillators showed spatially homogeneous and independent changes. OSC-DECOMP is a promising tool for data-driven extraction of oscillation components from biological time series data.

In this study, we investigate oscillatory changes in fNIRS signals of infants by using a statistical method for extracting oscillators from time series data, which we call the oscillator decompisition method (OSC-DECOMP). OSC-DECOMP determines the number, frequencies and powers of oscillators as well as their projection patterns in a data-driven manner and does not require arbitrary selection of band-pass filters. Three types of oscillators (brain activity, pulse wave, mirroring noise) were found and each oscillator showed a characteristic spatial synchrony. Model comparison with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) demonstrated that the time series of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb on each channel originate from common oscillatory activity.

Moran (1953) first introduced the concept of synchrony between population dynamics and concomitant weather conditions using Canadian lynx data showing that the degree of synchrony decreases with increasing distance and since then, it has been studied in various areas of research. Although spatial synchrony, which considers similarity across locations and species, has been studied widely, temporal synchrony, which considers timing of events, has been studied mostly in phenology. In a recent study, Naylor et al. (2007) suggested the possible use of variations in the ratios of oxygen and carbon isotopes to determine age, growth and reproductive patterns in shells of Haliotis iris. They suggested that oxygen isotope profiles within shells reflected ambient water temperature at the time of shell precipitation, and that these (delta O-18 and delta C-13) profiles could be used to determine age and growth patterns. Naylor et al. (2007) used two temperature series, ambient water temperature and isotopic temperature from shells. Their preliminary work indicated that two types of growth model, the von-Berterlanffy (VB) or the Gompertz (G) growth model were equally good in mirroring isotopic temperature. However, the G model was preferred to the VB model as it fitted better to tagging information data (Naylor et al. 2007). In this study, we look at the tracking indices of two temperature series, ambient water temperature and isotopic temperature of Naylor et al. (2007) to measure synchronicity. We show that temperature estimated from abalone shells using oxygen isotope profiles statistically track and/or synchronize with ambient water temperature. In terms of fitting isotopic temperature with ambient water temperature, one growth model, namely the von Berterlanffy (VB), fits significantly better than the G model. This is established using a block bootstrapping method to calculate the confidence interval of so the so-called tracking indices, that mirror synchrony. This work represents an improvement because the VB model and the G model, by their definition, give different biomass estimation for the future in terms of time and amount. The VB model will estimate smaller biomass than the G model, although the G model will take longer to build the available biomass, since it reaches the minimum legal size 2-6 years later than the VB model. By choosing the VB model over the G model, we are selecting a model where in a shell reaches the minimum legal size faster, although the biomass of the shell is not as heavy as the amount calculated via the G model. The impact on total biomass, in the future, via the VB and the G models was not examined in this study, and is future work. Tracking indices between two temperature series (isotopic - estimated shell temperature and ambient water temperature) were obtained for four shells: (a) between the two temperature series as they are, (b) between ambient water temperature and the kernel smoothed isotopic temperature; and (c) on the moving block bootstrapped series of isotopic temperature and ambient water temperature. The local bandwidth choice in Kernel regression showed the largest bandwidth of shell 3, which can be related to the smallest asymptotic length (L-infinity = 136.32 with VB) and slower growth rate (large K, K = 0.38 with VB) and the smallest bandwidth of shell 2, which can be related to the largest asymptotic length (L-infinity = 181.84 with VB) and its fast growth rate to the minimum legal size (Naylor et al. 2007). At the minimum legal size, shell 3 will be 6.6 years old whereas shell 2 will only be 4.4 years old. Tracking indices showed that the shell and water temperature series are synchronizing and parallel; and that the VB growth model synchronizes significantly better for shells 1, 3, and 4. The G growth model synchronizes significantly better for shell 2 only.",,,,,"; Kim, Susan/D-5144-2015","Hudson, Irene/0000-0002-9000-9556; Kim, Susan/0000-0002-0924-8964",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,511,517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290030700077,View Full Record in Web of Science

Economically significant damage is however limited to outbreak populations. To understand what determines outbreaks dynamics in this species, we developed an individual based model for a wasp population developing within a pine plantation. We show that outbreaks may be the result of the insect's life history. Specifically we show that limited dispersal may not only increase population persistence but also create the conditions for eruptive dynamics. When the probability of long distance dispersal is greater than zero, but relatively small (P-LDD = 0.1) large outbreaks are the norm, with all of the suitable trees dead at the end of the simulation. For P-LDD = 0 (only local dispersal allowed) outbreaks are smaller in size, and in some cases not well defined and spread over longer periods. For P-LDD = 1 (only long distance dispersal allowed), the frequency of local population extinction (without outbreaks) increases significantly. Aggregated attacks may induce physiological changes in the trees which could allow other wasps to detect them. These changes may in turn trigger an outbreak. In contrast, healthy, vigorous trees are not suitable for wasp oviposition. In our model the density of suitable trees (healthy trees but yet suitable for oviposition) are a key factor determining population persistence before outbreaks. From an applied perspective, our results emphasize the importance of adequate plantation management in preventing woodwasp infestation.",,,,,"Rabinovich, Jorge/AAI-2536-2019; aparicio, juan/F-1246-2011","Aparicio, Juan Pablo/0000-0001-5434-7454; Corley, Juan/0000-0002-8032-2223",,,,,,,,,,,,,1547-1063,1551-0018,,,,OCT-DEC,2013,10,5-6,,,SI,,1265,1279,,10.3934/mbe.2013.10.1265,http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2013.10.1265,,,,,,,,24245616,,,,,WOS:000324397300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In recent studies, it has been argued that sunspot activity forces the Epirrita autumnata 9-10-year outbreak periodicity in the mountain birch forest of Fennoscandia. For the following reasons, we challenge this conclusion. 2. With a 10-year outbreak cycle of E. autumnata and the 11-year sunspot cycle, it is expected that the cycles will run in-phase, out-of-phase and in-phase within 10 x 11 years. Hence, given such cycle lengths, sunspot activity should not affect outbreak periods. For a test, the E. autumnata series should be at least 110 years in length. 3. A well-documented E. autumnata outbreak series of 81 years (1888-1968; outbreak periods IV-XII) exists. This series is here lengthened to 114 years by adding outbreak frequencies for three decades (1969-2001). 4. By lengthening the series, three more E. autumnata/Operophtera brumata periods (XIII, XIV, XV) are identified. Period XV, like several earlier periods, was of the moving type, i.e. outbreaks moved in a wavelike manner from northern Fennoscandia to southern Norway. 5. As with several earlier outbreak periods in central northern Fennoscandia, the main timing of periods XIII-XV centred at the middle of the decades. In contrast, outbreaks at the extreme north-western coast of Norway centred at the decadal shifts, i.e. about 1979, 1989 and 1999. Supported by historical documents, we explain the 1979 and 1999 outbreaks as the final expressions of east-west outbreak waves that branched off from the main waves which moved southward during periods XIII and XV. These side-waves in the north are new observations. Outbreaks at the decadal shift 1989/1990 may have been of a more complex nature. 6. We find that sunspot activity does not explain outbreak waves. Furthermore, a test of our 114-year long E. autumnata series against the contemporaneous sunspot series shows that the two series run in-phase and out-of-phase. The observed interval between the two cycles coming in-phase agrees with the expected interval. This challenges the hypothesis of sunspot synchronization of the E. autumnata (and O. brumata) outbreaks.",,,,,"Bylund, Helena/F-3857-2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,MAR,2007,76,2,,,,,269,275,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01205.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01205.x,,,,,,,,17302834,,,,,WOS:000244113100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dispersal is known to promote both synchrony, which enhances the likelihood of extinction, and spatial heterogeneity, which favors the persistence of the population. Several efforts have been made to understand the effect of diverse variants of dispersal in the spatially distributed ecological community. Despite that environmental change strongly affects the dispersal, the effects of controlled dispersal on the metacom-munity stability and their persistence remain unknown. We study the influence of limiting the immigration using two-patch prey-predator metacommunity at both local and spatial scales. We find that the spread of the inhomogeneous stable steady states (asynchronous states) decreases monotonically upon limiting the predator dispersal. Nevertheless, at the local scale, the spread of the inhomogeneous steady states increases up to a critical value of the limiting factor, favoring the metacommunity persistence, and then starts decreasing for a further decrease in the limiting factor with varying local interaction. Interestingly, limiting the prey dispersal promotes inhomogeneous steady states in a large region of the parameter space, thereby increasing the metacommunity persistence at both spatial and local scales. Further, we show similar qualitative dynamics in an entire class of complex networks consisting of a large number of patches. We also deduce various bifurcation curves and stability conditions for the inhomogeneous steady states, which we find to agree well with the simulation results.

Synchrony may be an important variable in multispecies systems, but its nature and implications have not been explicitly examined. Because the number of locally coexisting species (richness) affects the population variability of community members, we manipulated richness under different regimes of environmental fluctuation (EF). We predicted that the temporal synchrony of populations in a species should decline with increasing richness of the metacommunity they live in. Additionally, we predicted that specialist species that are sensitive to a specific environmental factor would show higher synchronization when EF increases. We thus created experimental communities with varied richness, EF, and species specialization to examine the synchronizing effects of these factors on three aquatic invertebrate species. We created four levels of richness and three levels of EF by manipulating the salinity of the culture media. Monocultures exhibited higher population synchrony than metacommunities of 2-4 species. Furthermore, we found that species responded differently to EF treatments: high EF enhanced population synchrony for the specialist and intermediate species, but not for the generalist species. Our findings emphasize that the magnitude of EF and species richness both contribute to determine population synchrony, and importantly, our results suggest that biotic diversity may actually stabilize metacommunities by disrupting synchrony.",,,,,,"Cottenie, Karl/0000-0001-9498-8483",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,JAN,2013,171,1,,,,,237,247,,10.1007/s00442-012-2407-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-012-2407-8,,,,,,,,22791133,,,,,WOS:000313079100022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Researchers have recorded synchronization events in cone production in different populations, which allows the seed production to be concentrated, reducing the percentage of seeds consumed by different animal species. Methods We sampled three populations located in the Andes Mountains, Araucania Region, Chile. In 2004 we began the collection of data on cone production, for which we installed permanent plots (1200 m2 each) at each location. We identified and labeled each female tree in each plot to monitor its cone production. In 2012 we selected a total of 30 trees near the plots to evaluate the number of seeds per cone. In each February from 2012 to 2014 we selected two mature cones and covered them with a porous mesh for subsequent collection and storage in March. At the beginning of June, we counted and weighed the seeds, determining the average weight, the number of seeds per cone, the germination capacity (GC), and the germination speed (GS). Results Cone production was synchronous across the three locations. We observed significant differences among the locations and years evaluated. The cones had fewer seeds in 2013 (high production) compared to those in 2012 (low production), but their weights were similar. In 2014 the cones produced smaller seeds in fewer quantities. The difference between the years 2013 and 2014 resulted from the high-energy expenditure in 2013. Regarding GC and GS, there were significant differences among the three locations (GC: F = 45.41, p < 0.01; GS: F = 96.08, p < 0.01), where the highest values were observed in 2013. Conclusions Both GC and GS are related to seed weight but not to the number of cones produced in a given year. These annual fluctuations in seed production are determining factors in the population dynamics of forest species. Our results allow a better understanding of the reproductive phenology of A. araucana and could help define sustainable use and conservation actions for this species.",,,,,"Badaracco, Carolain/LFT-5566-2024","Santelices Moya, Romulo/0000-0002-5790-8701; Cabrera Ariza, Antonio Maria/0000-0003-3626-9645; espinoza quezada, claudia maria/0009-0000-4188-2925; Sergio, Donoso/0000-0002-4599-4702; Badaracco, Carolain/0000-0002-0040-254X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2192-1709,,,,MAR 5,2024,13,1,,,,,,,19,10.1186/s13717-024-00497-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-024-00497-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001176529600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Asian boreal forests extend southward to the Greater Khingan Range in northeast China. Given the ecological importance and susceptibility to climate change, the impacts of warming on this marginal forest community have been extensively investigated. Nonetheless, how tree growth synchrony changes across this region remains less understood. Focusing on this knowledge gap, we compiled a contiguously-distributed tree-ring network, containing 18 sampling populations and 475 individual larch trees, to explore the changes in multiple-scale growth synchrony across this region. We found increasing growth synchrony at both the individual and population levels over the past decades. The increasing trend of the regional inter-population growth synchrony was well in line with the increasing temperature and PDSI. Furthermore, 11 of the 18 sampling populations showed significant increases in their intra-population growth synchrony. We further associated the sliding intra-population growth synchrony with local climates. Intrapopulation growth synchrony of 13 and 11 sampling populations were significantly positively correlated with local temperature, and negatively correlated with local PDSI, respectively, demonstrating the driving role of warming -induced drought on growth synchrony. The linear regression model quantifying this relationship suggested that an increase of 1 degrees C in annual mean temperature would drive the intra-population growth synchrony to increase by 0.047. As warming trends in the study area are projected to continue over this century, our study warns of the further consequences of the increasing growth synchrony may have on the functioning, resilience, and persistence of forests.",,,,,"Li, Wenqing/GQQ-7582-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,AUG 15,2024,938,,,,,,,,173389,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173389,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173389,,MAY 2024,,,,,,38810743,,,,,WOS:001248568800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Synchronization of abundance has been widely observed across a range of spatial scales in relation to the rate of dispersal among discrete populations. However, the dependence of synchrony on patterns of among-patch movement across heterogeneous landscapes has been largely ignored. Here, we consider the duration of movement between two predator-prey communities connected by weak dispersal and its effect on population synchrony. More specifically, we introduce time-delayed dispersal to incorporate the finite transmission time between discrete populations across a continuous landscape. Reducing the system to a phase model using weakly connected network theory, it is found that the time delay is an important factor determining the nature and stability of phase-locked states. Our analysis predicts enhanced convergence to stable synchronous fluctuations in general and a decreased ability of systems to produce in-phase synchronization dynamics in the presence of delayed dispersal. These results introduce delayed dispersal as a tool for understanding the importance of dispersal time across a landscape matrix in affecting metacommunity dynamics. They further highlight the importance of landscape and dispersal patterns for predicting the onset of synchrony between weakly coupled populations.",,,,,"Humphries, Antony/R-5608-2017","Humphries, Antony/0000-0002-5736-1240",,,,,,,,,,,,,1874-1738,1874-1746,,,,NOV,2013,6,4,,,,,405,418,,10.1007/s12080-013-0176-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-013-0176-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000326461200002,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Grevstad, FS",,,,"Grevstad, FS",,,Factors influencing the chance of population establishment: Implications for release strategies in biocontrol,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Successful establishment of biological control agents is hampered by factors that put small populations at risk of extinction; among these are demographic stochasticity, environmental variability, and Allee effects. I used a stochastic simulation model to tease apart the influences of these three factors on the relationship between release size and the probability of population establishment. The fates of simulated colonies indicated that demographic stochasticity alone is not likely to be important in the establishment of biological control agents, but both environmental variability and Allee effects are crucial. These two factors are distinct in the way they interact with the initial colony size. The presence of an Allee effect results in a threshold response; below a critical colony size a population is doomed, and above that size establishment is likely. In contrast, environmental variability reduces the likelihood of establishment over the entire range of colony sizes. In combination, these factors have an intermediate effect, that is, a gradual increase in establishment rate with initial colony size. These results can be used to design release strategies that will. maximize the probability of successful establishment given the inherent trade-off between the size of each release and the number of releases. In a variable environment, a large number of very small-sized releases will maximize the chance of overall establishment. When an Allee effect is present (in a constant environment), a single large release is optimal. For some combinations of both factors, there will be an intermediate optimum release size (and corresponding number of releases). This study provides an avenue for improving the rate of successful biological control through wisely designed releases.

To illustrate this hypothesis, we assessed the consequences of European policies implementation affecting subsidy availability on the temporal synchrony of egg volume as a proxy of breeding investment in two sympatric marine top predators with differential subsidy use. We show how 7-year synchrony appears on egg volume fluctuations after subsidy cessation suggesting that food subsidies could disrupt interspecific synchrony.

Measuring functional connectivity, the ability of species to move between resource patches, is essential for conservation in fragmented landscapes. However, current methods are highly time consuming and expensive. 2. Population synchrony- the correlation in time series of counts between two long-term population monitoring sites, has been suggested as a possible proxy measure of functional connectivity. To date, population synchrony has been shown to correlate with proxies for movement frequency such as the coverage of suitable habitat types in intervening landscapes, and also least cost distances around hostile land cover types. 3. This provides tentative evidence that synchrony is directly driven by movements of the focal species, but an alternative explanation is that these land cover types affect the movement of interacting species (e.g. natural enemies of the focal species) which can also drive synchronous population dynamics. Therefore, what is needed is a test directly relating population synchrony to movement frequencies of a focal species. 4. Here we use data from a 21year mark-release-recapture study and show that population synchrony does indeed predict movements of a focal butterfly species Boloria eunomia (Esper). 5.

To address this problem for three vertebrate species (Northern Bobwhite [Colinus virginianus], Ring-necked Pheasants [Phasianus colchicus], and eastern cottontails [Sylvilagus floridanus]), we examined spatially subdivided, long-term (1966-2001), seasonal (January, April, July, and October), time-series data from the Kansas Rural Mail Carrier Survey, USA. All three species have range boundaries in Kansas, with population abundances declining toward the periphery of their ranges. We quantified the strengths of density-dependent and density-independent processes affecting the dynamics of 10 populations of each species ranging from low (peripheral) to high (central) mean abundance using first-order autoregressive models that incorporate measurement error. For all three species, peripheral populations with lower mean abundance tended to have greater population variability. This pattern could potentially be explained by peripheral regions experiencing either weaker density dependence or greater environmentally driven density-independent fluctuations in per capita population growth rates. In general, density dependence did not vary among geographic regions, although there was a trend for smaller, peripheral populations to exhibit stronger density dependence. Density-independent variability in per capita population growth rates was higher in peripheral populations. Furthermore, density-independent fluctuations in per capita population growth rates were weakly correlated with temperature and precipitation and were highest for the period October through January, identifying fall as the period of greatest environmentally driven variability in population dynamics. Per capita population growth rates fluctuated in moderate synchrony among regions, especially for more abundant, nonperipheral populations in close geographical proximity. The strong density-dependent and stronger density-independent processes in smaller, peripheral populations suggest that the greater variability in peripheral populations' densities is caused by greater population sensitivity to environmental fluctuations. This may make peripheral populations more likely to go extinct and leads to the prediction that, if these species decline to the point of becoming endangered, this decline will be accompanied by a contraction in their geographical ranges.",,,,,"Applegate, Roger/J-2615-2019; Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008; Williams, Chris/B-4037-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,OCT,2003,84,10,,,,,2654,2667,,10.1890/03-0038,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-0038,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000186599300015,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the usefulness of TPL exponents as an ecological metric has been questioned, largely due to its apparent ubiquity in various complex systems. The aim of this study was to test whether TPL exponents vary systematically with potential drivers of animal aggregation in time and space and therefore capture useful ecological information of the system of interest. We derived community TPL exponents from a long-term, standardised and spatially dense data series of abundance and body size data for a strongly size-structured fish community in the North Sea. We then compared TPL exponents between regions of contrasting environmental characteristics. We find that, in general, TPL exponents vary more than expected under random conditions in the North Sea for size-based populations compared to communities considered by species. Further, size-based temporal TPL exponents are systematically higher (implying more temporally aggregated distributions) along hydrographic boundaries. Time series of size-based spatial TPL exponents also differ between hydrographically distinct basins.

Such synchrony can arise via several possible mechanisms, including shared environmental effects and shared trophic interactions, but distinguishing the relative importance among different mechanisms can be challenging. We analyze interannual time series of population densities of the larch budmoth,Zeiraphera griseana(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), along with six sympatric larch-feeding folivores from a site in the European Alps 1952-1979. These species include five lepidopterans,Exapate duratella,Ptycholomoides aeriferana,Spilonota laricana,Epirrita autumnataandTeleiodes saltuum, and one hymenopteran sawflyPristiphora laricis. We document that the highly regular oscillatory behavior (period 9-10 years) ofZ.griseanapopulations is similarly evident in the dynamics of most of the sympatric folivores. We also find that all of the sympatric species are phase synchronized withZ.griseanapopulations with half of the sympatric species exhibiting nonlagged phase synchrony and three of the species exhibiting 2-5 year lags behindZ.griseanapopulations. We adapt a previously developed tritrophic model ofZ.griseanadynamics to explore possible mechanisms responsible for observed phase synchronization. Results suggest that either shared stochastic influences (e.g., weather) or shared parasitoid impacts are likely causes of nonlagged phase synchronization. The model further indicates that observed patterns of lagged phase synchronization are most likely caused by either shared delayed induced host plant defenses or direct density-dependent effects shared withZ.griseana.",,,,,"Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008; Bjornstad, Ottar/I-4518-2012; klapwijk, maartje johanna/D-8187-2013","klapwijk, maartje johanna/0000-0001-7690-045X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-3896,1438-390X,,,,OCT,2020,62,4,,,,,372,384,,10.1002/1438-390X.12060,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1438-390X.12060,,AUG 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000562892800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, determining sources of synchrony is important for understanding metapopulations and biodiversity patterns in response to environmental disturbance. Previously, we found that the experimental extinction of two contiguous subpopulations of the butterfly Parnassius smintheus, increased synchrony among nearby subpopulations relative to distant controls. We hypothesized that increased synchrony was caused by either 1) a Moran-like effect where the loss of immigrants simultaneously reduced the abundance of surrounding subpopulations or 2) an increase in dispersal among subpopulations surrounding the extinction. Reestablishment following extinction allowed for discrimination of these hypotheses. Additional data and new analyses using 24-years of population growth in 12 nearby and control subpopulations before, during and after the experimental extinction show that our initial result was wrong. The 'increase' in synchrony seen during the extinction was due to synchrony being low among treatment subpopulations during the pre-extinction period, rather than an increase due to the experimental extinction. Lower synchrony among treatment subpopulations prior to extinction may have been due to less dispersal among treatment than among control subpopulations during the pre-extinction period. Population crashes inducing synchrony (a Moran effect) during the extinction and post-extinction periods also appear to have had greater and more lasting effects on synchrony for treatment than control subpopulations. Theoretical models show that local population extinction can increase synchrony in metapopulations, particularly for tightly regulated populations, but further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis.",,,,,"Roland, Jens/A-3749-2014","Roland, Jens/0000-0001-8452-6648; Matter, Stephen/0000-0001-7119-4357",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,JAN,2022,2022,1,,,,,,,,10.1111/oik.08675,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.08675,,NOV 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000718332500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we evaluated different functional forms in which climatic variables could influence population dynamics of the oak aphid Tuberculatus annulatus both in each locality and in relation to synchrony between localities. Results indicate that in at least four of eight aphid populations, climate influences population dynamics by modifying the carrying capacity of the system (lateral effect mediated by winter precipitation). Additionally, path analysis showed that synchrony in population dynamics is highly correlated with synchrony in winter precipitation regime, and the spatial scale of both processes is similar, which suggests that this is an example of the Moran effect.

One such impact may be changes to population synchrony (defined as correlated fluctuations in the density of separate populations). It is well established that synchrony depends on both dispersal ability and correlated environmental conditions, for example shared climate. However, what is not clear is whether differences in habitat or position within a species' range also mediate synchrony. Since synchronous metapopulations are thought to be more extinction-prone, establishing the drivers of synchrony has clear conservation implications. Using three butterfly species (Maniola jurtina, Pyronia tithonus and Aphantopus hyperantus) we investigated the effects of habitat similarity and range position on population synchrony, after accounting for the effects of distance and climate. Range position was present in all minimum adequate models, though non-significant using Mantel randomization tests in one case. We show that M. jurtina and P. tithonus synchrony is not consistent across species' ranges, with marginal populations showing more synchronous dynamics. Increased climatic constraints on marginal populations, leading to a narrower range of suitable microhabitats may be responsible for this, which is supported by the result that habitat similarity between sites was also positively correlated with population synchrony. As the landscape becomes increasingly homogeneous, overall population synchrony may be expected to rise. We conclude that habitat modification and climate change have the capacity to drive changes in population synchrony that could make species more vulnerable to extinction.",,,,,"Oliver, Tom/K-2670-2012; Roy, David/A-6619-2009; Chapman, Daniel/C-2900-2008","Powney, Gary/0000-0003-3313-7786; Roy, David/0000-0002-5147-0331; Chapman, Daniel/0000-0003-1836-4112; Oliver, Tom/0000-0002-4169-7313",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,OCT,2010,119,10,,,,,1690,1696,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18168.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.18168.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000281833700017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we determine whether terrestrial vegetation (measured by the enhanced vegetation index, EVI) also shows a geography of synchrony and we infer determinants of EVI synchrony. As vegetation is the basis of the terrestrial food web, changes in spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics may have major consequences. Location: The land. Time period: 2001-2014. Major taxa: Plants. Methods: Synchrony in terrestrial vegetation is mapped globally. Spatial statistics and model selection are used to identify main statistical determinants of synchrony and of geographical patterns in synchrony. Results: The first main result is that there is a pronounced and previously unrecognized geography of synchrony for terrestrial vegetation. Some areas, such as the Sahara and Southern Africa, exhibited nearly perfect synchrony, whereas other areas, such as the Pacific coast of South America, showed very little synchrony. Spatial modelling provided the second main result, namely that synchrony in temperature and precipitation were major determinants of synchrony in EVI, supporting the presence of dual global Moran effects. These effects depended on the time-scales on which synchrony was assessed, providing our third main result, namely that synchrony of EVI and its geography are time-scale specific. Main conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to document the geography of synchrony in terrestrial vegetation. We showed that geographical variation in synchrony is pronounced. We used geographical patterns to identify determinants of synchrony.

A total of 49 fish species were captured, revealing a lognormal distribution as expected for species-rich assemblages. Fish species exhibited a range of habitat use patterns, from generalist to highly habitat-specific, and appeared to migrate laterally among habitats between seasons. Species richness was homogenous among habitats in the wet season yet appeared to increase with isolation from the main river in the dry season. Fish assemblage structure was best explained by the interaction between habitat type and season, underlining the importance of the natural flow regime and lateral connectivity among floodplain habitats.

Here, we analyse the effect of diet specialisation, mobility, length of the flight period, and distance to the northern edge of the species' distribution in relation to between-year population fluctuations and synchrony of butterfly species. All butterfly species associated with grasslands were surveyed over five successive years at 19 grassland sites in a forest-dominated landscape (50 km(2)) in southern Sweden. At both the local and regional level, we found larger population fluctuations in species with longer flight periods. Population fluctuations were more synchronous among localities in diet specialists. Species with a long flight period might move more to track nectar resources compared to species with shorter flight period, and if nectar sources vary widely between years and localities it may explain that population fluctuations increase with increasing flight length. Diet generalists can use different resources (in this case host plants) at different localities and this can explain the lower synchrony in population fluctuations among generalist species. Higher degree of synchrony is one possible explanation for the higher extinction risks that have been observed for more specialised species.

We develop here a formal context upon which to base the measurement and interpretation of egg recruitment in population dynamics of eastern and western spruce budworms, two geographically separated species that share a very similar ecology. Under most circumstances, per capita egg recruitment rates in these budworms are higher in low-density populations and lower in high-density populations, relative to the regional mean: Low-density populations are nearly always migration sinks for gravid moths, and dense populations nearly always sources. The slope of this relationship, measured on a log scale, is negatively correlated with migration rate, and ranges between 0 and -1. The steeper the slope, the more marked net migration. Using our western spruce budworm observations, we found strong evidence of density-dependent emigration in budworms, so migration is not simply a random perturbation in the lagged, density-dependent stochastic process leading to budworm outbreaks. It is itself statistically and biologically density-dependent. Therefore, moth migration is a synchronizing factor and a spread mechanism that is essential to understanding the development and expansion of spruce budworm outbreaks at regional scales in the boreal forests of North America.",,,,,,"Regniere, Jacques/0000-0002-5453-5890",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1999-4907,,,,AUG,2019,10,8,,,,,,,706,10.3390/f10080706,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10080706,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000482949200063,View Full Record in Web of Science

While simulating agent-based models is often straightforward, predicting their behaviour mathematically has remained a key challenge. Recently developed mathematical methods allow the prediction of the emerging spatial patterns for a general class of agent-based models, whereas the prediction of spatio-temporal pattern has been thus far achieved only for special cases. We present a general and mathematically rigorous methodology that allows deriving the spatio-temporal correlation structure for a general class of individual-based models. To do so, we define an auxiliary model, in which each agent type of the primary model expands to three types, called the original, the past and the new agents. In this way, the auxiliary model keeps track of both the initial and current state of the primary model, and hence the spatio-temporal correlations of the primary model can be derived from the spatial correlations of the auxiliary model. We illustrate the agreement between analytical predictions and agent-based simulations using two example models from theoretical ecology. In particular, we show that the methodology is able to correctly predict the dynamical behaviour of a host-parasite model that shows spatially localized oscillations.",,,,,"Finkelshtein, Dmitri/ADL-5353-2022; Ovaskainen, Otso/AGN-4838-2022; Ovaskainen, Otso/D-9119-2012","Finkelshtein, Dmitri/0000-0001-7136-9399; Ovaskainen, Otso/0000-0001-9750-4421",,,,,,,,,,,,,1742-5689,1742-5662,,,,OCT 28,2020,17,171,,,,,,,20200655,10.1098/rsif.2020.0655,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0655,,,,,,,,33109018,,,,,WOS:000586510000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, to overcome this difficulty, we combine traditional correlation analysis with a novel framework of nonlinear time series analysis, empirical dynamic modeling (EDM). The EDM is an analytical framework to identify causal relationships and measure changing interaction strength from time series. We apply this approach to time series of sympatric foliage-feeding forest Lepidoptera species in the Slovak Republic and yearly mean temperature, precipitation and North Atlantic Oscillation Index. These Lepidoptera species include both free-feeding and leaf-roller larval life histories: the former are hypothesized to be more strongly affected by similar exogenous environments, while the latter are isolated from such pressures. Correlation analysis showed that interspecific synchrony is generally strongest between species within same feeding guild. In addition, the convergent cross mapping analysis detected causal effects of meteorological factors on most of the free-feeding species while such effects were not observed in the leaf-rolling species. However, there were fewer causal relationships among species. The multivariate S-map analysis showed that meteorological factors tend to affect similar free-feeding species that are synchronous with each other. These results indicate that shared meteorological factors are key drivers of interspecific synchrony among members of the free-feeding guild, but do not play the same role in synchronizing species within the leaf-roller guild.",,,,,"Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008; Kawtasu, Kazutaka/B-1066-2010","Kawatsu, Kazutaka/0000-0003-4447-4761",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-3896,1438-390X,,,,JAN,2020,62,1,,,,,5,14,,10.1002/1438-390X.12025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1438-390X.12025,,NOV 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000494670000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It can help identify factors that regulate populations, and also the scales at which these factors exert their influence. Using long-term data from seven Brunnich's guillemot colonies in Svalbard, Norway, we determined that year to year population fluctuations were synchronized in six of the seven colonies. The seventh colony was located farther away and in a different oceanographic system. Moreover, all seven colonies have declined significantly since the late 1990s following a very similar pattern. If the rate of population decline does not change, Brunnich's guillemots in Svalbard have a high probability of becoming quasi-extinct within the next 50 years. The high synchrony between the different colonies could further increase this risk of extinction. Our results indicate that environmental forcing plays a role in the colony size fluctuation of Brunnich's guillemot (i.e., a Moran effect). These fluctuations are well explained by changes in the subpolar gyre in the region where Brunnich's guillemots overwinter. This subpolar gyre weakened in the mid-1990s, leading to a warming of the North Atlantic. Our study indicates that this basin-scale shift in the subpolar gyre is closely related to the decline in Brunnich's guillemot in Svalbard. Our results suggest that the causal mechanism linking changes in oceanographic conditions in the North Atlantic and Brunnich's guillemot population dynamics are likely mediated, at least partly, by changes in recruitment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,DEC,2013,173,4,,,,,1271,1282,,10.1007/s00442-013-2701-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2701-0,,,,,,,,23771803,,,,,WOS:000328210000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there is little information on the frequency of outbreaks of this defoliator for previous centuries. This information is needed to establish baselines defining the historic range of variability of this disturbance, to calculate potential depletions in timber supply from defoliation, and to refine forest management plans. Also, precise estimates of budworm recurrence are needed to assess potential ecosystem changes and possible departures from the historic range of this disturbance due to global warming. We used dendrochronology and time series analysis to determine past frequency of spruce budworm outbreaks in southern BC and found that, since the 1500s, outbreaks have been periodic, with a mean return interval of 28 years (95% Confidence Interval 21-35 years).

The effects of such climatic forcing are often coherent over relatively large geographic areas. Temporal trends in wave exposure at any particular shore are, however, the result of an interaction between site-specific fetch characteristics and changes in wind climate. This leads to contrasting trends in wave exposure at locations separated by no more than a few kilometres. Wave exposures were estimated at locations around a sea tough over 32 years to characterise, these scales of variability. Locations separated by approximately 5 km had independent dynamics with respect to the temporal trend (correlation range -0.35 to 0.44) and to associations with the NAO (correlation range -0.18 to 0.40). Wave exposure can therefore be increasing for a section of shore while nearby areas have the opposite trend. Mean exposure at a location was not a good predictor of the temporal trend. More exposed sites were. however, sensitive to variations in the strength of the NAO. The reduction of large scale forcing to small-scale variability has implications for the detection and mitigation of potential climate change impacts. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Using structural equation modelling, support for each hypothesis was evaluated at two spatial scales: across Canada and dividing the country into three regions longitudinally. Our results showed that at both scales mink synchrony is a major factor determining muskrat synchrony, supporting the hypothesis of trophic-level interactions, but the influence of winter precipitation synchrony is also important in eastern Canada. Moreover, mink synchrony is influenced principally by winter precipitation synchrony at the level of all Canada (Moran effect), but by distance at regional level, which might suggest some influence of dispersal at this level.

Synchrony may arise through coupling that is weak and continuous, but in populations that cycle with a characteristic period, synchrony can be maintained through stronger coupling that acts only intermittently. Here, we apply a discrete Markov model that describes the state of a population trajectory to be in one of four possible states. The Markov model reveals the nature of the coupling that gives rise to the weakly synchronous cycles of red grouse abundance. Using time-series data from 287 populations across the species range in the UK, we show that grouse populations appear mostly uncoupled through time, but that approximately one year in six, collective forcing events'' occur, where populations in a region are forced into synchrony to a significantly greater degree than would be expected if their dynamics proceeded independently. In the absence of these events, synchrony between populations dissipates within similar to 3 yr.

However, there is a lack of knowledge about the causes of this variability and its trajectories through time. Here, we examine whether climate can explain variation in within-population synchrony (WPS) across space but also through time and we develop models capable of explaining this variation. These models can be applied to the global tree cover under current and future climate change scenarios. Location Global. Time period 1901-2012. Major taxa studied Trees. Methods We estimated WPS values from a global tree-ring width database consisting of annual growth increment measurements from multiple trees at 3,579 sites. We used generalized linear mixed effects models to infer the drivers of WPS variability and temporal trends of global WPS. We then predicted WPS values across the global extent of tree cover. Finally, we applied our model to predict future WPS based on the RCP 8.5 (2045-2065 period) emission scenario. Results Areas with the highest WPS are characterized by a combination of environments with both high mean annual temperature (>10 degrees C) and low precipitation (<300 mm). Average WPS across all temperate forests has decreased historically and will continue to decrease. Potential implications of these patterns include changes in forest dynamics, such as higher tree growth and productivity and an increase in carbon sequestration. In contrast, the WPS of tropical forests of Central and South America will increase in the near future owing to reduced annual precipitation.

We developed a novel regional dynamic conceptual model of mountain pine beetle infestation using the tree mortality estimated from the British Columbia annual aerial overview survey to quantitatively determine short-distance dispersal (SDD) and long-distance dispersal (LDD) at local (forest district) and regional (provincial) scales. The dispersal patterns were characterized based on distances between a sink patch to its nearest source patch. At the regional scale, SDD accounted for 85.3% of mountain pine beetle dispersal to non-infested areas and 96.8% of beetle dispersal to infested areas. Although SDD was a dominant dispersal mode, LDD played a more important role in the early stage of the current mountain pine beetle outbreak. At the local scale, three patterns of dispersal to non-infested areas were identified. First, LDD dominated in the forest districts where only sparse infestations occurred. Second, LDD was a dominant or important factor in the early stages of the infestations in some districts. Third, SDD dominated throughout the infestations in more severely infested forest districts. However, for dispersal to infested areas, SDD was a dominant mode in most of the forest districts. We conclude from the spatiotemporal patterns of dispersal observed at local and regional scales that LDD is a key factor in the initiation and early stage of the infestations in new remote areas, and SDD dominate in the spread and expansion of the outbreak as the infestations intensify and reach epidemic levels.

We use long-term monitoring in relation to two environmental manipulations to evaluate the importance of exogenous environmental factors versus endogenous feedbacks for synchrony in this species. Our past research showed that synchrony in this species is explained by the pollen-coupling hypothesis: plants that flower synchronously set seed and deplete stored resources, whereas plants that happen to flower asynchronously are pollen limited, set fewer seeds, and do not deplete resources, and flower again until they are resynchronized. Continued monitoring of two experimental manipulations, water addition, and flower removal, provides additional support for this model, and also reveals subtle effects of water availability on synchrony. Water addition decreased flowering, rather than increasing it as expected based on simple correlations with weather variables, suggesting that precipitation does not synchronize reproduction. Exogenous drivers are generally considered to be the primary synchronizing factors in plant reproduction.

Their detection in simple ecological models has been taken as evidence that transient dynamics may be common in nature. In this study, we explore the generality of these phenomena in a simple one-dimensional spatially explicit metapopulation model. We investigate how frequently supertransient behaviour emerges in relation to the shape and type of the dispersal kernel used (normal and Laplace), system size, boundary conditions and how sensitive they are to initial conditions. Our results show that supertransients are rare, are heavily affected by initial conditions and occur for a small set of dispersal parameter values, which vary according to kernel type, system size, and boundary conditions. Similarly, mesotransients emerge over a very narrow range of dispersal parameter values and are rare under all circumstances.

Range boundaries are long--term biogeographic features of species distributions and abundance. However, many species demonstrate dynamic range boundaries, reflecting strong seasonal and annual variability in migratory behaviour. 2. As a form of facultative migration, irruptions involve the movement of many individuals outside of their resident range in response to climate variability, resource availability, and demographic processes. Many species have experienced range shifts and altered phenology in response to modern climate change, but spatiotemporal changes in irruption dynamics are less well known. 3. We quantified changes in the geography and periodicity of boreal bird irruptions across eastern North America from 1960 to 2021. Using data from Audubon's Christmas Bird Count for nine finch species, including several exhibiting recent population declines, we evaluated latitudinal trends in southern range and irruption boundaries and characterized irruption periodicity using spectral wavelet analysis. 4. Six boreal birds exhibited significant northward shifts in their southern range boundaries and three species displayed shifts in their southern irruption boundaries. 5. Irruption periodicity across multiple species was consistent across the 1960s and 1970s, culminating in frequent and synchronized irruptions of multiple species (superflights) during earlier decades. Coherence between species dampened beginning in the early 1980s as superflight periodicity became increasingly unstructured, finally reforming in recent decades, after 2000. 6.

It is often thought that climate factors influencing the growth of conspecific populations are correlated over large distances and hence produce the synchronous population dynamics - an effect known as the Moran effect. However, for species embedded in a food web the Moran effect needs not necessarily influence the focal species directly, but can act indirectly through other species. Such an indirect synchronization can also occur in an age-structured population, where the correlated environment of one age-class causes synchronous fluctuations of another. Here, we investigate this indirect Moran effect. We find first of all that synchrony is readily transferred through food webs or between age classes, which complicates the identification of the underlying synchronizing factor. Secondly, we find puzzling cases, where synchrony is enhanced as it is filtered through a food web or between age-classes.

Growth differences among individual trees due to microclimatic conditions and local disturbances are averaged in developing tree-ring chronologies.

In this paper, we present data that illustrate how temporal variation in population density at a regional scale can influence landscape-moderated variation in recolonization and population buildup in disturbed habitat patches. Four common insect species, two omnivores and two herbivores, were monitored over 8years in 10 willow short-rotation coppice bio-energy stands with a four-year disturbance regime (coppice cycle). The population densities in these regularly disturbed stands were compared to densities in 17 undisturbed natural Salix cinerea (grey willow) stands in the same region. A time series approach was used, utilizing the natural variation between years to statistically model recolonization as a function of landscape composition under two different levels of regional density. Landscape composition, i.e. relative amount of forest vs. open agricultural habitats, largely determined the density of re-colonizing populations following willow coppicing in three of the four species. However, the impact of landscape composition was not detectable in years with low regional density.

In ecology, long-range synchronization of oscillations in spatial populations may elevate extinction risk and signal an impending catastrophe. The prevailing assumption is that synchronization on distances longer than the dispersal scale can only be due to environmental correlation (the Moran effect). In contrast, we show how long-range synchronization can emerge over distances much longer than the length scales of either dispersal or environmental correlation. In particular, we demonstrate that the transition from incoherence to long-range synchronization of two-cycle oscillations in noisy spatial population models is described by the Ising universality class of statistical physics.

Furthermore, there is reason to believe ECEs may modify tail associations between distinct population vital rates, or between values of an environmental variable measured in different locations. Tail associations between two variables are associations that occur between values in the left or right tails of the distributions of the variables. Two positively associated variables can be principally left-tail associated (i.e., more correlated when they take low values than when they take high values) or right-tail associated (more correlated when they take high than low values), even with the same overall correlation coefficient in both cases. We tested, in the context of non-spatial stage-structured matrix models, whether tail associations between stage-specific vital rates may influence extinction risk. We also tested whether the nature of spatial tail associations of environmental variables can influence metapopulation extinction risk. For instance, if low values of an environmental variable reduce the growth rates of local populations, one may expect that left-tail associations increase metapopulation extinction risks because then environmental catastrophes are spatially synchronized, presumably reducing the potential for rescue effects. For the non-spatial, stage-structured models we considered, left-tail associations between vital rates did accentuate extinction risk compared to right-tail associations, but the effect was small. In contrast, we showed that density dependence interacts with tail associations to influence metapopulation extinction risk substantially: For population models showing undercompensatory density dependence, left-tail associations in environmental variables often strongly accentuated and right-tail associations mitigated extinction risk, whereas the reverse was usually true for models showing overcompensatory density dependence. Tail associations and their asymmetries are taken into account in assessing risks in finance and other fields, but to our knowledge, our study is one of the first to consider how tail associations influence population extinction risk. Our modeling results provide an initial demonstration of a new mechanism influencing extinction risks and, in our view, should help motivate more comprehensive study of the mechanism and its importance for real populations in future work.",,,,,"Ghosh, Shyamolina/AAV-2109-2021; Sheppard, Lawrence/KFB-7678-2024","Sheppard, Lawrence/0000-0002-9032-2059; Ghosh, Shyamolina/0000-0002-5137-9933",,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,MAY,2020,11,5,,,,,,,e03132,10.1002/ecs2.3132,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3132,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000538094900029,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results indicated that environmental synchrony strongly explained trout synchrony over distances less than 75 km. This effect was partly due to a negative influence on 0+ trout of strong discharges during the emergence period and a more complex influence of substrate mobility during the spawning period.

Using a two-patch meta-ecosystem model of mussel bed dynamics, we show that non-resource effects of matter on the structural stability of mussel beds promote pulsed releases of matter and fluctuations in population abundance. These pulsed fluctuations explain the maintenance of meta-ecosystem heterogeneity in the distribution of abundance and matter through out-of-phase synchrony and asynchrony over a broad range of connectivity.

There was evidence for an influence of climate on population demographic rates, but the direction and magnitude of responses to climate drivers was highly variable among taxa and among populations within taxa. These results reveal that climate drivers interact with variation in life-history traits and population-specific attributes resulting in a diversity of responses. This heterogeneity complicates the identification of conservation 'rules of thumb' for these taxa, and supports the notion of local focus as the most effective approach to overcome global-scale conservation challenges.",,,,,"Grant, Evan/N-5160-2014; Fisher, Robert/AAA-7301-2022; Pilliod, David/D-1782-2013; Schmidt, Benedikt R./B-8491-2008","Green, David M./0000-0003-4438-2285; Chambert, Thierry/0000-0002-9450-9080; Pilliod, David/0000-0003-4207-3518; Schmidt, Benedikt R./0000-0002-4023-1001",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,DEC 6,2017,7,,,,,,,,17102,10.1038/s41598-017-17105-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17105-7,,,,,,,,29213103,,,,,WOS:000417136400012,View Full Record in Web of Science

A corollary of this hypothesis is that manipulations of forest structure and composition can be used to reduce future forest vulnerability. However, to what extent historical forest management has influenced current spatial patterns of spruce budworm host species is unknown. To identify landscape-scale spatial legacies of forest management in patterns of spruce budworm host species (i.e., Abies balsamea and Picea spp.), we analyzed remotely sensed forest data from the Border Lakes landscape of northern Minnesota and northwestern Ontario. Our study area contains three regions with different management histories: (1) fine-scale logging patterns in Minnesota, (2) coarse-scale logging patterns in Ontario, and (3) very limited logging history in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and adjacent Quetico Provincial Park. We analyzed forest basal-area data using wavelets and null models to identify: (1) at which scales forest basal area is structured, (2) where those scales of pattern are significantly present, and (3) whether regions of local significance correspond to regional boundaries that separate the study area. Results indicate that spatial patterns in host basal area are created by nonstationary processes and that these processes are further constrained by lakes and wetlands. Wavelet analysis combined with significance testing revealed a bimodal distribution of scale-specific wavelet variance and separate zones of host species basal area that partially correspond with regional boundaries, particularly between Minnesota and the Wilderness region. This research represents one of the first comparisons of forest spatial structure in this region across an international border and presents a novel method of two-dimensional wavelet analysis that can be used to identify significant scale-specific structure in spatial data.",,,,,"Sturtevant, Brian/KHV-0383-2024; Townsend, Philip/B-5741-2008","Townsend, Philip/0000-0001-7003-8774",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,SEP,2011,21,6,,,,,2197,2209,,10.1890/09-1876.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-1876.1,,,,,,,,21939054,,,,,WOS:000294155900025,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Matter, SF",,,,"Matter, Stephen F.",,,Increases and decreases in network synchrony associated with local population extinction and recolonization,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Synchronous population dynamics, a positive correlation in growth rates among populations, is of interest from basic and applied perspectives. Synchronous dynamics are ubiquitous in nature thus understanding the mechanisms producing synchrony is fundamental. Population networks with synchronous dynamics have shorter persistence times than asynchronous networks, thus understanding its sources may aid conservation. Previous research has shown that the extinction and recolonization of local populations within a spatial population network produces a decrease in synchrony: however, models investigating extinction alone have shown increases in synchrony and the potential for increased network wide extinction risk. Here, I investigated these contrasting results. At low population growth rates, r = 1.1, the extinction and recolonization of a local population increased the synchrony of surrounding populations. Also in contrast to previous results, at higher growth rates, r > 2.1, extinction-recolonization dynamics resulted in a range of results - increasing, decreasing, and no change in synchrony. In all cases, the impact of extinction and recolonization dynamics on synchrony depended on whether dispersal was local or global, the population growth rate, the emigration rate, and the amount of local stochasticity. Results indicate that there is a high potential for positive feedback of local extinction and recolonization on network-wide extinction risk for patchy populations of species with low intrinsic growth rates.

Conservation measures for fragmented and declining populations may need to address such local effects to avoid local extinction before measures at large spatial scales become effective. To assess differences in local population dynamics, we aimed to determine the demographic drivers controlling population trends in three remaining populations of the Northern Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe in the Netherlands, as a basis for conservation actions. An integrated population model (IPM) was fitted to field data collected in each site in 2007-2011 to estimate fecundity, survival and immigration. Sites were 40-120km apart, yet first-year recruits were observed to move between some of the sites, albeit rarely. All three populations were equally sensitive to changes in fecundity and first-year survival. One population was less sensitive to adult survival but more sensitive to immigration. A life table response experiment suggested that differences in immigration were important determinants of differences in population growth between sites. Given the importance of immigration for local dynamics along with high philopatry, resulting in low exchange between sites, creating a metapopulation structure by improving connectivity and the protection of local populations are important for the conservation of these populations. Site-specific conservation actions will therefore be efficient and, for the short term, we propose different site-specific conservation actions.",,,,,"Siepel, Henk/Q-8145-2019","Schekkerman, Hans/0000-0003-3127-4832",,,,,,,,,,,,,0019-1019,1474-919X,,,,JAN,2015,157,1,,,,,91,102,,10.1111/ibi.12205,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12205,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000346347700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, theory is unclear as to whether dispersal will provide spatial insurance when environmental conditions are changing directionally. In particular, increased temperatures as a result of climate change are expected to cause synchronous growth or decline across species and communities, and this has the potential to erode the stabilizing compensatory dynamics facilitated by dispersal. Here we report on an experimental test of how dispersal affects the diversity and stability of metacommunities under warming using replicate two-patch pond zooplankton metacommunities. Initial differences in local community composition and abiotic conditions were established by seeding each patch in the metacommunities with plankton and sediment from one of two natural ponds that differed in water chemistry and species composition. We exposed metacommunities to a 2 degrees C increase in average ambient temperature, crossed with three rates of dispersal (none, intermediate, high). In ambient conditions, intermediate dispersal rates preserved diversity and stabilized metacommunities by promoting spatially asynchronous fluctuations in biomass, especially between local populations of the dominant genus, Ceriodaphnia. However, warming synchronized their populations so that these effects of dispersal were lost. Furthermore, because the stabilizing effect of dispersal was primarily due to asynchronous fluctuations between populations of a single genus, metacommunity biomass was stabilized, but dispersal did not stabilize local community biomass. Our results show that dispersal can preserve diversity and provide stability to metacommunities, but also show that this benefit can be eroded when warming is directional and synchronous across patches of a metacommunity, as is expected with climate warming.",,,,,"Gonzalez, Andrew/F-2247-2010; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020; Thompson, Patrick/B-6213-2012","Thompson, Patrick/0000-0002-5278-9045; Gonzalez, Andrew/0000-0001-6075-8081; Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,SEP,2015,124,9,,,,,1171,1180,,10.1111/oik.01945,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.01945,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000360823400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used cone abscission scars to reconstruct ca 15 years of recent cone production in Pinus edulis and Pinus ponderosa, and used redundancy analysis to relate time series of annual cone production to climate indices describing the North American monsoon and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We show that the sensitivity to climate and resulting synchrony in cone production varies substantially between species. Cone production among populations of P. edulis was much more spatially synchronous and more closely related to large-scale modes of climate variability than among populations of P. ponderosa. Large-scale synchrony in P. edulis cone production was associated with the North American monsoon and we identified a dipole pattern of regional cone production associated with ENSO phase. In P. ponderosa, these climate indices were not strongly associated with cone production, resulting in asynchronous masting patterns among populations.

In oaks, the dramatic fluctuations of acorn production impact its reproductive success and regeneration, the dynamics of a large diversity of seed consumers that rely on it, and, by cascade effects, the dynamics of the entire forest community. However, reproductive effort is difficult to quantify and there is therefore an urgent need of a reliable assessment of the dynamic of acorn production based on a low-cost, unbiased, and robust tool. One of the most commonly used method, the visual on-tree method, is very easy and quick to carry out, but is biased under high seed production or when branches are difficult to see. We here assessed the robustness of an alternative method, the ground plot (GP), based on a unique annual ground survey after peak of acorn fall, which has not been tested so far. We compared this method at tree and site levels (10 forests throughout France) with the costly and time-consuming trap acorn collection (TNR) method (used here as a reference method). We show that results from the GP method closely matched with those obtained using the TNR method, which demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of the GP method at both tree and forest site levels.

In colonial species, populations are limited by local resource availability. However, individuals from larger colonies will travel greater distances to overcome density-dependent competition. Consequently, these individuals may also experience greater carry-over effects and interpopulation differences in demography. To test this prediction, we use mark-recapture data collected over four decades from two breeding colonies of a seabird, the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), that exhibit strong spatial overlap throughout the annual cycle but differ in population size and maximum foraging distances. We quantify interpopulation differences and synchrony in rates of survival and assess whether local mean wind speeds act to strengthen or disrupt synchrony. In addition, we examine whether the imputed interpopulation differences in survival can generate population-level consequences. The colony where individuals travel further during the breeding season had slightly lower and more variable rates of survival, indicative of individuals experiencing greater carry-over effects. Fluctuations in survival were highly synchronous between the colonies, but neither synchronous, nor asynchronous, variation could be strongly attributed to fluctuations in local mean wind speeds. Finally, we demonstrate that the imputed interpopulation differences in rates of survival could lead to considerable differences in population growth. We hypothesise that the observed interpopulation differences in rates of adult survival reflect carry-over effects associated with foraging distances during the breeding season. More broadly, our results highlight that breeding season processes can be important for understanding interpopulation differences in the demographic rates and population dynamics of long-lived species, such as seabirds. Populations that spatially overlap on foraging grounds can experience divergent costs if factors determining access to resources differ. To test this prediction, we used mark-recapture data to quantify interpopulation differences and synchrony in rates of survival between two colonies of a trans-Atlantic migratory seabird that exhibit strong spatial overlap throughout the annual cycle but differ in population size and distance to foraging grounds.image",,,,,"Esmonde, Niamh/JXY-4693-2024; Kirk, Holly/HHC-6449-2022; Wood, Matt/B-6124-2011","Horswill, Cat/0000-0002-1795-0753; Warwick-Evans, Victoria/0000-0002-0583-5504; Wood, Matt/0000-0003-0920-8396; Kirk, Holly/0000-0002-8724-3210",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,OCT,2023,13,10,,,,,,,e10455,10.1002/ece3.10455,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10455,,,,,,,,37799448,,,,,WOS:001075451300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Synchrony is most commonly attributed to three processes: factors that influence recruitment (e. g., dispersal, early survival), large-scale environmental variability, and spatially autocorrelated trophic interactions. However it is often difficult to link population synchrony to a specific dominant process, particularly when multiple synchronizing forces are operating. We utilized a new satellite-based data set of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) canopy biomass to examine population synchrony in southern California kelp forests on spatial scales ranging from 50 m to 300 km and temporal scales ranging from 1 to 11 years. We examined the relationship between synchrony and distance for adult kelp populations, kelp recruits, sea urchin abundance (a major grazer of kelp), and environmental variables known to influence kelp population dynamics. Population synchrony in giant kelp decreased with distance between populations: an initial rapid exponential decrease between 50 m and 1.3 km was followed by a second, large-scale decrease between distances of 1.3 km and 172 km. The 50-m to 1.3-km spatial scale corresponded to the scales of synchrony in the abundance of sea urchins and young kelp recruits, suggesting that local drivers of predation and recruitment influence small-scale synchrony in kelp populations. The spatial correlation patterns of environmental variables, particularly wave height, were similar to the synchrony-distance relationship of kelp populations from 1.3 km to 172 km, suggesting that regional environmental variability, i.e., the Moran effect, was the dominant process affecting synchrony at larger spatial scales. This two-step pattern in the relationship between kelp biomass synchrony and distance was apparent in each of the 11 years of our study.

We use population synchrony as a new empirical method to assess functional connectivity the permeability of landscapes given species dispersal attributes. Functional connectivity is important because well-connected metapopulations are expected to be more resistant to stochastic events causing extinction. 2. A variety of factors impact population synchrony, and we attempt to account for several of these (shared climate, distance, habitat similarity and location within the range) before investigating impacts of the suitability of the landscape between populations - a proxy for permeability to dispersal. 3. For the Speckled Wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria), we find that population synchrony is positively correlated with landscape suitability, suggesting that synchrony might be used to measure functional connectivity. 4. The importance of landscape suitability for population synchrony shows a humped relationship with distance -suitability has no effect between 0 and 20 km, then showing a significant positive effect above 20 km but with reduced (still significant) effect from 160 to 200 km. This suggests that relatively close populations may exchange sufficient migrants for synchronisation, regardless of the matrix suitability. In contrast, more separate populations are synchronised only where the landscape permits functional connectivity, most likely through dispersal between intermediate stepping-stone populations. 5. Synthesis and applications. We show that patterns of synchrony in long-term monitoring data can be used to estimate functional connectivity of landscapes.

Such relationships are used often in hypotheses relating interannual variability in fruit production with tree resources or favourable pollinating conditions and with synchrony in fruit production among sites through the Moran effect (the synchronisation of biological processes among populations driven by meteorological variability) or the local availability of pollen. Climatic teleconnections, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), representing weather packages, however, have rarely been correlated with fruit production, despite often being better predictors of ecological processes than is local weather. The aim of this study was to test the utility of seasonal NAO indices for predicting interannual variability and synchrony in fruit production using data from 76 forests of Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercus petraea, and Q. robur distributed across central Europe. Interannual variability in fruit production for all species was significantly correlated with seasonal NAO indices, which were more prominently important predictors than local meteorological variables. The relationships identified by these analyses indicated that proximal causes were mostly responsible for the interannual variability in fruit production, supporting the premise that local tree resources and favourable pollinating conditions are needed to produce large fruit crops. Synchrony in fruit production between forests was mainly associated with weather and geographical distance among sites.

At the Alpine arc scale the presence of travelling waves could generally be confirmed. These results have implications for the understanding of the causal mechanisms behind the observed spatio-temporal patterns, suggesting that at the valley scale synchrony depends not only on distances between subpopulations, but is also affected by environmental/habitat characteristics that vary in space.

However, for the analytical tractability, there is a need to develop an explicit model to ask how the temperature-dependent dispersal alters ecological dynamics. We investigate the persistence of species in a spatial ecological model, where dispersal is considered as a function of temperature. Spatial persistence is of major concern and dispersal is reasonably an important factor for extinction risk in the context of promoting synchrony. Our study yields how the temperature influences species decision of dispersal, resulting in either short-range or long-range dispersal. We examine synchronous or asynchronous behavior of species under their thermal dependence of dispersal. Moreover, we also analyze the transients to study the collective behavior of species away from their final or asymptotic dynamics.

In 1990-2003, during a complete 10-year outbreak cycle, the synchrony of the birch defoliating outbreaks of the geometrids Epirrita autumnata and Operophtera brumata was studied quantitatively in the northern part of the Fennoscandian mountain chain (the Scandes). Data were supplemented with similar data from 1964 to 1966 and historical information. A 30-year series of field data from one locality in southern Scandes made possible interregional comparisons. 2. In 1991, outbreaks started in north-eastern Fennoscandia and moved westward like a wave and reached the outer coast of north-western Norway in about 2000. This wave is a new observation. In the same years, a previously documented outbreak wave moved southward along the Scandes. 3. Outbreak periods have usually occurred around the middle of each decade. Seemingly unrelated population peaks at the decadal shift 2000 were reported from islands at the coast of north-western Norway. They are shown here to have been the final ripples of the east-west wave. 4. At some localities, O. brumata peaked 2 years after E. autumnata. A lag of 1 or 2 years also occurred at the locality in southern Scandes. This interspecific time lag is a new observation. In accordance with the north-south wave, a time-lag of 1-2 years occurred between the fluctuations of northern and southern E. autumnata and O. brumata populations. 5. The population peak of E. autumnata occurred 1 year earlier at one locality than at a nearby locality. This pattern and particular altitudinal shifts of the O. brumata population density at these localities repeated in two outbreak periods. This indicates that, for example, local climate may modify outbreak synchrony between nearby localities. 6. At the same localities, O. brumata peaked first at one altitude and 1 or 2 years later at another altitude. This vertical lag is a new observation. 7. E. autumnata shows fluctuation traits similar to some other cyclic animals, e.g. the larch budmoth in the European Alps, some European tetraonid birds and the Canadian snow-shoe hare.

We examine an outbreak of mountain pine beetle covering an 800 thousand ha area on the Chilcotin Plateau of British Columbia, Canada, during the 1970s and early 1980s. We present a model that incorporates the spatial and temporal arrangements of outbreaking insect populations, as well as various climatic factors that influence insect development. Onsets of eruptions of mountain pine beetle demonstrated landscape-level synchrony. On average, the presence of outbreaking populations was highly correlated with outbreaking populations within the nearest 18 km the same year and local populations within 6 km in the previous two years. After incorporating these spatial and temporal dependencies, we found that increasing temperatures contributed to explaining outbreak probabilities during this 15 yr outbreak. During collapse years, landscape-level synchrony declined while local synchrony values remained high, suggesting that in some areas host depletion was contributing to population decline. Model forecasts of outbreak propensity one year in advance at a 12 by 12 km scale provided 80% accuracy over the landscape, and never underestimated the occurrence of locally outbreaking populations.

Many of these species are regarded as endangered, but there is little understanding of the population structure and extinction risks of these species. In this study I show that one of the most endangered beetles, Osmoderma eremita, has a population structure which conforms to that of a metapopulation, with each tree possibly sustaining a local population. This was revealed by performing a mark-release-recapture experiment in 26 trees over a 5-year period. The spatial variability between trees was much greater than temporal variability between years. The population size was on average 11 adults tree(-1) year(-1), but differed widely between trees (0-85 adults tree(-1) year(-1)). The population size in each tree varied moderately between years [mean coefficient of variation (C.V.)=0.51], but more widely than from sampling errors alone (P = 0.008, Monte Carlo simulation). The population size variability in all trees combined, however, was not larger than expected from sampling errors alone in a constant population (C.V. = 0.15, P = 0.335, Monte Carlo simulation). Thus, the fluctuations of local populations cancel each other out when they are added together. This pattern can arise only when the fluctuations occur asynchronously between trees. The asynchrony of the fluctuations justifies the assumption usually made in metapopulation modelling, that local populations within a metapopulation fluctuate independently of one another. The asynchrony might greatly increase persistence time at the metapopulation level (per stand), compared to the local population level (per tree). The total population size of O. eremita in the study area was estimated to be 3,900 individuals. Other localities sustaining O. eremita are smaller in area, and most of these must be enlarged to allow long-term metapopulation persistence and to satisfy genetic considerations of the O. eremita populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,JAN,2001,126,2,,,,,208,215,,10.1007/s004420000515,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420000515,,,,,,,,28547619,,,,,WOS:000166494800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Resource pulses are rare events with a short duration and high magnitude that drive the dynamics of both plant and animal populations and communities(1). Mast seeding is perhaps the most common type of resource pulse that occurs in terrestrial ecosystems(2), is characterized by the synchronous and highly variable production of seed crops by a population of perennial plants(3,4), is widespread both taxonomically and geographically(5), and is often associated with nutrient scarcity(6). The rare production of abundant seed crops (mast events) that are orders of magnitude greater than crops during low seed years leads to high reproductive success in seed consumers and has cascading impacts in ecosystems(2,7). Although it has been suggested that mast seeding is potentially synchronized at continental scales(8), studies are largely constrained to local areas covering tens to hundreds of kilometres. Furthermore, summer temperature, which acts as a cue for mast seeding(9), shows patterns at continental scales manifested as a juxtaposition of positive and negative anomalies that have been linked to irruptive movements of boreal seed-eating birds(10,11). Here, we show a breakdown in synchrony of mast seeding patterns across space, leading to asynchrony at the continental scale. In an analysis of synchrony for a transcontinental North America tree species spanning distances of greater than 5,200 km, we found that mast seeding patterns were significantly asynchronous at distances of greater than 2,000 km apart (all P < 0.05). Other studies have shown declines in synchrony across distance, but not asynchrony. Spatiotemporal variation in summer temperatures at the continental scale drives patterns of synchrony in mast seeding, and we anticipate that this affects the spatial dynamics of numerous seed-eating communities, from insects to small mammals to the large-scale migration patterns of boreal seed-eating birds.",,,,,"LaMontagne, Jalene/AFM-3725-2022; Koenig, Walter/A-5509-2009","Koenig, Walter/0000-0001-6207-1427; LaMontagne, Jalene/0000-0001-7713-8591",,,,,,,,,,,,,2055-026X,2055-0278,,,,MAY,2020,6,5,,,,,460,+,,10.1038/s41477-020-0647-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41477-020-0647-x,,APR 2020,,,,,,32341539,,,,,WOS:000528989300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Densities and biomasses peaked toward the saltier parts of the study area and showed relatively larger variations toward the low saline edge. Temporally, the areas showed a consistent increase in abundance after a synchronized large-scale recruitment event, which was followed by a decline in population size, occurring much faster toward the very range edge. Salinity, temperature, winter severity, and wave exposure explained most of the spatiotemporal variation in mussel abundances and adults showed positive effects on recruit abundance. We show empirically that the dynamics of edge populations are not driven by large changes in climate variables but that small spatial and temporal changes in key environmental variables have large and non-linear population level effects. Our results also show that fluctuating recruitment is a key factor for population stability affecting the storage potential of marginal populations, which dramatically decrease toward the edge.

Since similar negative feedback responses were apparent under both normal and environmentally limiting conditions when populations crash, a single population model that could simulate the differing regional dynamics observed from the annual surveys was produced.

We designed a study to reliably estimate red oak acorn yield in five states in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley over 4 consecutive years (2009-2013) and evaluate the components of masting (i.e., synchrony and temporal variability). The mean annual individual tree yield was 424 kg (dry)/ha (35.1 acorns/m(2) crown area) across all sites and years.

In our study, red oaks yielded more acorns on average and showed less annual variability than studies of other red oaks in North America. We found no evidence that annual population-level red oak acorn yield was synchronized at sites across the scale of the MAV. However, synchrony increased with decreasing distance between sites, and we found a large degree of interspecific synchronicity within four of our five sites. We believe that local scale influences such as edaphic resources, weather, and genetics drive within-site yearly patterns in acorn yield.

Synchronization may appear as a result of either interhabitat dispersal or regionally correlated environmental stochastic factors, the latter being known as the Moran effect. In this article, we consider the population dynamics of a common agricultural pest insect, Tipula paludosa, on a fragmented habitat by analyzing data derived from a multiannual survey of its abundance in 38 agricultural fields in southwestern Scotland. We use cross-correlation coefficients and show that there is a considerable synchronization between different populations across the whole area. The correlation strength exhibits an intermittent behavior, such that close populations can be virtually uncorrelated, but populations separated by distances up to approximately 150 km can have a cross-correlation coefficient close to one. To distinguish between the effects of stochasticity and dispersal, we then calculate a time-lagged cross-correlation coefficient and show that it possesses considerably different properties to the nonlagged one. In particular, the time-lagged correlation coefficient shows a clear directional dependence. The distribution of the time-lagged correlations with respect to the bearing between the populations has a striking similarity to the distribution of wind velocities, which we regard as evidence of long-distance wind-assisted dispersal.",,,,,"Hastings, Alan/O-6864-2019","Bearup, Daniel/0000-0001-8524-7659; Petrovskii, Sergei/0000-0001-6259-2695; Hastings, Alan/0000-0002-0717-8026",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,,,,,SEP 1,2013,182,3,,,,,393,409,,10.1086/671162,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/671162,,,,,,,,23933728,,,,,WOS:000322901300011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The onset of egg laying varied markedly among years but was roughly synchronous across islands within years. Despite this synchrony, island populations varied markedly in reproductive rate, mainly from spatial variation in nest depredation and brood parasitism. In general, populations farther from Vancouver Island and with fewer resident predators experienced less nest depredation and brood parasitism, and higher reproductive rates, than populations closer to Vancouver Island.

In this study, we explored the impact of the migration rate in a coupled map lattice system. To capture this impact, we assumed symmetric dispersal and simple dynamics in the local populations. However, we allowed heterogeneity between the patches, including both source-source and source-sink systems. Our results show that this simple theoretical setting has the potential to unify the diversity of behaviours of the total population size observed in previous studies. Indeed, we found that the response of the total population size to migration was non-monotone in source-source and many source-sink situations, thereby suggesting that an increase in the dispersal rate could be related to either an increase or a decrease in the total population size. As we will illustrate, this response provides a possible theoretical explanation of some benefits of control strategies involving spatial considerations as no-take zones. Our study also analyses the impact of the migration rate on persistence, spatial coherence, and initial transients. This was motivated by previous theoretical observations in coupled systems that the rate of migration affects these three aspects. Related to persistence, we rigorously extended a previous result from the linear to the non-linear case. This result essentially states that persistence depends on the stability of the origin. On the other hand, we stress that negative effects due to an increase of the spatial coherence could be neutralised by the unimodal response of the total population size. Finally, the study of the initial transients, which is relevant for interpreting experimental results, highlights that the relationship between the rate of migration and the total population size remains the same even in the transient phase.

We describe a statistical model for the analysis of individual monitoring data at the multi-population scale that allows us to (1) split up temporal variation in survival into two components that account for these two types of processes and (2) evaluate the role of environmental factors in generating these two components. We derive from this model an index of synchrony among populations in the pattern of temporal variation in survival, and we evaluate the extent to which environmental factors contribute to synchronize or desynchronize survival variation among populations. When applied to individual monitoring data from four colonies of the Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica), 67% of between-year variance in adult survival was accounted for by a global spatial-scale component, indicating substantial synchrony among colonies. Local sea surface temperature (SST) accounted for 40% of the global spatial-scale component but also for an equally large fraction of the local-scale component. SST thus acted at the same time as both a synchronizing and a desynchronizing agent. Between-year variation in adult survival not explained by the effect of local SST was as synchronized as total between-year variation, suggesting that other unknown environmental factors acted as synchronizing agents. Our approach, which focuses on demographic mechanisms at the multi-population scale, ideally should be combined with investigations of population size time series in order to characterize thoroughly the processes that underlie patterns of multi-population dynamics and, ultimately, range dynamics.",,,,,"Gimenez, Olivier/G-4281-2010; Anker-Nilssen, Tycho/AAB-7666-2022","Anker-Nilssen, Tycho/0000-0002-1030-5524",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,OCT,2009,90,10,,,,,2922,2932,,10.1890/08-1657.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1657.1,,,,,,,,19886500,,,,,WOS:000270274200027,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some outbreaks occur simultaneously across large geographic scales and some outbreaks occur periodically every few years across space. Parasitoids are a natural enemy of these defoliators and could help mitigate these pest outbreaks. A holistic understanding of the host-parasitoid interactions in a spatial context would thus enhance our ability to understand, predict and prevent these outbreaks. We use a discrete time deterministic model of the host parasitoid system with populations migrating between 2 patches to elucidate features of spatial host outbreaks. We show that whenever populations persist indefinitely, host outbreaks in both patches can occur alternatively (out of phase) at low migration between patches whereas host outbreaks always occur simultaneously (in phase) in both patches at high migration between patches. We show that our results are robust across a large range of parameters across different modelling approaches used typically to model intraspecific competition among hosts and parasitism, in the host-parasitoid literature. We give an analytical expression for the period of oscillations when the migration is low i.e. , when host outbreaks in both patches are out of phase, show it is in agreement with numerical results.

This synchronization is mainly driven by heavy rain on snow that encapsulates the vegetation in ice and blocks winter forage availability for herbivores. Thus, indirect and bottom-up climate forcing drives the population dynamics across all overwintering vertebrates.

We here present methods that analyse autocorrelation and synchrony in ecological datasets using a spectral approach combined with Bayesian inference. To exemplify, we implement the method on dendrochronological data of the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). The data consist of 110 years of growth of 10 live trees and seven trees that died during a synchronized oak death in Sweden in c. 2002-2007. We find that the highest posterior density is found for a noise colour of tree growth of gamma approximate to 0.95 (i.e. pink noise) with little difference between trees, suggesting climatic variation as a driving factor. This is further supported by the presence of synchrony, which we estimate based on phase-shift analysis. We conclude that the synchrony is time-scale dependent with higher synchrony at larger time-scales. We further show that there is no difference between the growth patterns of the alive and dead tree groups. This suggests that the trees were driven by the same factors prior to the synchronized death.

Understanding the population dynamics of these local populations is becoming increasingly important for effective conservation efforts. In this study, we used data from grey partridge transect counts with call playback from 2006 to 2023 to investigate the population dynamics of a grey partridge population in central Germany. We employed generalized linear mixed models to model the long-term meta-population trend and assessed synchrony between local sub-populations by calculating the cross-correlation and the Loreau and de Mazancourt community-wide synchrony. Additionally, we assessed stability by comparing the extent of yearly fluctuations between sub-populations and the regional meta-population by analysing variances. Our analysis revealed that the studied meta-population remained stable over the course of the study period, despite ongoing declines observed in other regions of Germany. Furthermore, we found that the population dynamics of the sub-populations were largely asynchronous, and the extent of variance in the sub-populations was significantly greater than in the meta-population. The low synchrony between sub-populations indicates a prevalence of local factors affecting population dynamics, but further research is needed to identify these factors. Our results suggest that asynchrony between sub-populations may play a role in stabilizing meta-populations at the landscape level. Based on our results, we argue that large-scale conservation projects that are able to encompass these population dynamics may help ensure the long-term persistence of the grey partridge.",,,,,,"Gottschalk, Eckhard/0000-0002-7622-5682",,,,,,,,,,,,,0909-6396,1903-220X,,,,2024 OCT 16,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/wlb3.01316,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wlb3.01316,,OCT 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001333760800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, despite strong evidence linking shifts in these ecological processes to corresponding shifts in abiotic factors driven by climate change, the mechanisms connecting population size to season-specific climate drivers are little understood. Using a 21-year dataset and a Bayesian state space model, we identified biologically informed seasonal climate covariates that influenced densities of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), a cold-adapted boreal herbivore. We found that snow and temperature had strong but conflicting season-dependent effects. Reduced snow duration in spring and fall and warmer summers were associated with lowered hare density, whereas warmer winters were associated with increased density. When modeled simultaneously and under two climate change scenarios, the negative effects of reduced fall and spring snow duration and warmer summers overwhelm the positive effect of warmer winters, producing projected population declines.

Here, we ask whether the population dynamics of similar sympatric species of a seabird breeding community are synchronized, and if these species have similar exceptional responses to environmental variation. We used a 24-year time series of the breeding success and population growth rate of a marine top predator species group to assess the degree of synchrony between species demography. We then developed a novel method to examine the species group - all species combined - response to environmental variability, in particular, whether multiple species experience similar, pronounced fluctuations in their demography. Multiple species were positively correlated in breeding success and growth rate. Evidence of exceptional years was found, where the species group experienced pronounced fluctuations in their demography. The synchronous response of the species group was negatively correlated with winter sea surface temperature of the preceding year for both growth rate and breeding success. We present evidence for synchronous, exceptional responses of a species group that are driven by environmental variation. Such species covariation destabilizes communities by reducing the portfolio effect, and such exceptional responses may increase the risk of a state change in this community.

Synchronous dynamics can amplify the destabilizing effect of environmental variability on ecosystem functions such as productivity, whereas the inverse, compensatory dynamics, can stabilize function. Here we combine simulation and empirical analyses to elucidate mechanisms that underlie patterns of synchronous versus compensatory dynamics. In both simulated and empirical communities, we show that synchronous and compensatory dynamics are not mutually exclusive but instead can vary by timescale. Our simulations identify multiple mechanisms that can generate timescale-specific patterns, including different environmental drivers, diverse life histories, dispersal, and non-stationary dynamics. We find that traditional metrics for quantifying synchronous dynamics are often biased toward long-term drivers and may miss the importance of short-term drivers.

This reduces the permeability of landscapes to the movement of individuals and reduces the likelihood of metapopulation persistence. Quantifying functional connectivity, the ability of a focal species to move between resource patches, is therefore essential for conservation management. There is substantial evidence supporting a technique based on 'population synchrony'- the degree of correlation in time-series of annual population growth rates between different long-term monitoring sites, to provide a measure of functional connectivity. However, synchronised population dynamics are not only driven by the movement of individuals between sites, but also shared environmental conditions which must be accounted for. Here, we use species survey data from over four decades to investigate average levels and temporal trends in population synchrony for 58 British bird and butterfly species. We first show that population synchrony is significantly associated with synchrony in some seasonal climatic variables. Once we accounted for spatiotemporal climatic patterns, we found that synchrony in butterflies declined over time by 71% between 1985 and 2000 but increased by 64% in recent years. Synchrony in birds showed some decline between 1999 and 2005, after which there appears to being recovery, however most species (74%) show no significant overall change in synchrony. Our proposed indicator provides a 'species-eye-view' of functional connectivity using widely available abundance data.

Our analysis also shows that the addition of a new apex predator makes, as expected, the different species more prone to extinction.

Although this is often attributed to observation noise, factors including local environmental differences, spatially variable dynamics, and chaos might also reduce or eliminate metapopulation synchrony. To differentiate spatially variable dynamics from similar dynamics driven by spatially variable environments, we applied hierarchical delay embedding. A unique output of this approach, the dynamic correlation, quantifies similarity in intrinsic dynamics of populations, independently of whether their abundance is correlated through time. We applied these methods to 17 populations of blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) along the US Atlantic coast and found that their intrinsic dynamics were broadly similar despite largely independent fluctuations in abundance. The weight of evidence suggests that the latitudinal gradient in temperature, filtered through a unimodal response curve, is sufficient to decouple crab populations. As unimodal thermal performance is ubiquitous in ectotherms, we suggest that this may be a general explanation for the weak synchrony observed at large distances in many marine species, although additional studies are needed to test this hypothesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,1091-6490,,,,JAN 7,2020,117,1,,,,,479,485,,10.1073/pnas.1910964117,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1910964117,,,,,,,,31871191,,,,,WOS:000506001200070,View Full Record in Web of Science

We develop a hierarchical integrated population model with which all relevant demographic rates from all study populations can be estimated and apply it to demographic data of barn swallows Hirundo rustica from nine sites that were between 19 and 224km apart from each other. We decompose the variation of the population growth and of the demographic rates (apparent survival, components of productivity, immigration) into global and local temporal components using random effects which allowed the estimation of synchrony of these rates. The barn swallow populations fluctuated synchronously, but less so than most demographic rates. The highest synchrony showed the probability of double brooding, while fledging success was highly asynchronous. Apparent survival, immigration and total productivity achieved intermediate levels of synchrony. The growth of all populations was most sensitive to changes in immigration and adult apparent survival, and both of them contributed to the observed temporal variation of population growth rates. Using a simulation model, we show that immigration and apparent survival of juveniles and adults were able to induce population synchrony, but not components of local productivity due to their low population growth rate sensitivity. Immigrants are mostly first-time breeders, and consequently, their number depends on the productivity of neighbouring populations. Since total productivity was synchronized, we conclude that it contributed to population synchrony in an indirect way through dispersing individuals which appear as immigrants at the local scale. The hierarchical integrated population model is promising for achieving an improved mechanistic understanding of population synchrony.",,,,,,"Gruebler, Martin U./0000-0003-4468-8292; Schaub, Michael/0000-0003-2745-0557",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,NOV,2015,84,6,,,,,1530,1541,,10.1111/1365-2656.12423,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12423,,,,,,,,26179225,,,,,WOS:000362741000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we investigated the spatial form and timing of a population collapse from 2018 to 2022 in Canada lynx ( Lynx canadensis) across the northwest boreal forest. We analyzed survival, reproduction, and dispersal data from 143 individual global positioning system (GPS) collared lynx from populations across five study sites spanning interior Alaska to determine whether lynx displayed characteristics of a population wave following a concurrent wave in snowshoe hare ( Lepus americanus) abundance. Reproductive rates declined across the study sites; however, site-level reproduction declined first in our easternmost study sites, supporting the idea of a population wave. Despite a clear increase in percent of dispersing lynx, there was no evidence of directional bias in dispersal following a hare population wave. Analysis did show increasingly poor survival for lynx dispersing to the east compared to combined resident and westward dispersal. This pattern is consistent with a survival-mediated population wave in lynx as the driver of the theorized population wave. The combination of these factors supports the idea of a hierarchical response to snowshoe hare population declines with a drop in lynx reproduction followed by increased dispersal, and finally reduced survival. All of this evidence is consistent with the expected characteristics of a population undergoing a traveling wave and supports the hypothesis that lynx presence may facilitate and mirror the underlying wave patterns in snowshoe hare.",,,,,"Laufenberg, Jared/JZD-7403-2024","Arnold, Derek/0009-0006-4926-7613",,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,1091-6490,,,,OCT 8,2024,121,41,,,,,,,e2414052121,10.1073/pnas.2414052121,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2414052121,,,,,,,,39348535,,,,,WOS:001349235200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In small, vulnerable populations, where chance or random events between individuals may have disproportionately large effects on species interactions, such local processes are particularly important. However, existing theory often only describes the dynamics of metapopulations at regional scales, neglecting the role of multispecies population dynamics within habitat patches. Findings: By coupling analysis across spatial scales we quantified the interaction between local scale population regulation, regional dispersal and noise processes in the dynamics of experimental host-parasitoid metapopulations.

Contrasts in butterfly assemblage structure were examined in nine 450 ha landscapes in logged forest, primary unburned continuous and isolated forest, and forest affected by surface fires during the 1997/98 ENSO event. Temporally the effect of the 1997/98 ENSO event was followed in a single burned landscape from 1997 to 2004. In total, 517 species were present in 190 sampling sites. There was a five-fold difference in species richness among landscapes, with highest richness in continuous landscapes and lowest richness in burned landscapes. Richness was also higher in logged forest than proximate unlogged forest. Temporally, species richness dropped dramatically from 1997 to 1998, but afterwards increased remaining, however, substantially lower than pre-ENSO (1997) sampling. Sites in burned landscapes were distinct from other sites in terms of vegetation structure with the slash-and-burn area the most dissimilar to other landscapes. There was much less structure among unburned landscapes. The pattern of butterfly community composition was similar to that of vegetation structure with the community from the slash-and-burn area the most distinct. However, there was much less overlap among sites from different landscapes. Temporally, 1998 possessed the most distinct assemblage when compared to assemblages from other years. The community composition was, however, slowly returning to a pre-disturbance composition. Variance in community composition explained by environmental and spatial factors differed substantially among landscapes. The spatial fraction was the only explanatory component in recently burned landscapes and a proximate small unburned isolate, but explained no variation in logged landscapes. The environmental fraction explained substantial amounts of variation in logged landscapes and the slash-and-burn area. When all landscapes were pooled high proportions of variation in butterfly community composition were explained by both geographic distance between sites and environmental variables. In contrast when only unburned landscapes were considered, most variation was explained by the geographic distance among them. Despite differences among landscapes there was a general pattern of relatively sharp decline in similarity at short distances that levels out over greater distances, a result that agrees with previous studies on other tropical species assemblages.",,,,,"Cleary, Daniel/HLH-8491-2023; Cleary, Daniel/D-2582-2012","Cleary, Daniel/0000-0002-6143-3390",,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,,,JAN,2006,15,1,,,,,517,538,,10.1007/s10531-005-2353-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-005-2353-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000236032000034,View Full Record in Web of Science

One widely accepted theory to explain this behaviour is the predator satiation hypothesis, which states that the synchronous and variable production of seeds within a population will maximize the probability of seed survival through satiation of seed predators. Although some short-term studies have documented the influence of variable and synchronized production of seeds on herbivore attack rate during one or few mast years, long-term data including multiple mast seeding years and patterns of cone production and herbivore attack on individual trees are needed to assess (i) how cone production, variability and synchrony affect individual plant fitness and (ii) the functional responses of seed predators to mast seeding events. We tested these objectives, collecting long-term (29years) data on female seed cone production and rates of seed predator attack from 217 individual contiguous trees within a Pinus ponderosa population. Our results support the predator satiation hypothesis. First, we found high interannual synchrony and variability in seed cone production and a type II functional response of seed predators to available cones. Secondly, years with high cone production (mast years) had markedly lower rates of seed predator attack than years of low production (i.e. a population-level satiation effect). Thirdly, within mast years, individuals with high cone production had markedly lower rates of attack than individuals with low cone production (i.e. an individual-level satiation effect). Finally, individual trees with greater synchrony and more variable cone production suffered lower rates of attack.

Ignoring sampling error in population dynamics models induces bias in parameter estimators, e.g., density-dependence. In particular, when sampling errors are independent among populations, the classical estimator of the synchrony strength (zero-lag correlation) is biased downward. However, this bias is rarely taken into account in synchrony studies although it may lead to overemphasizing the role of intrinsic factors (e.g., dispersal) with respect to extrinsic factors (the Moran effect) in generating population synchrony as well as to underestimating the extinction risk of a metapopulation. Methodology/Principal findings: The aim of this paper was first to illustrate the extent of the bias that can be encountered in empirical studies when sampling error is neglected. Second, we presented a space-state modelling approach that explicitly accounts for sampling error when quantifying population synchrony. Third, we exemplify our approach with datasets for which sampling variance (i) has been previously estimated, and (ii) has to be jointly estimated with population synchrony. Finally, we compared our results to those of a standard approach neglecting sampling variance. We showed that ignoring sampling variance can mask a synchrony pattern whatever its true value and that the common practice of averaging few replicates of population size estimates poorly performed at decreasing the bias of the classical estimator of the synchrony strength. Conclusion/Significance: The state-space model used in this study provides a flexible way of accurately quantifying the strength of synchrony patterns from most population size data encountered in field studies, including over-dispersed count data.

Mate-finding failure, a common mechanism contributing to demographic Allee effects, is usually difficult to demonstrate because of the arduous nature of sampling individuals at very low densities. In a rising outbreak of the eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), we used caged and tethered virgin females in traps to measure mating success over population densities ranging from deep endemic to outbreak conditions. We found that mating success increased with increasing population density, and that at endemic population densities, females experienced difficulties attracting males and mating, demonstrating for the first time a mate-finding Allee effect in the spruce budworm. The relationship between population density and mating success is nonlinear. As population density increased, the proportion of mated females eventually reached a plateau and mating success was not 100% even at the highest moth densities, probably due to female reluctance to mate and perhaps interference competition by males for access to females. Both laboratory-reared and wild females were equally effective in synthesizing pheromone, attracting males, and mating. Our results strongly suggest that a mate-finding Allee effect is involved in maintaining low-density spruce budworm populations below an Allee threshold where they fail to grow.

J,"Blowes, SA; Connolly, SR",,,,"Blowes, Shane A.; Connolly, Sean R.",,,"Risk spreading, connectivity, and optimal reserve spacing",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two important processes determining the dynamics of spatially structured populations are dispersal and the spatial covariance of demographic fluctuations. Spatially explicit approaches to conservation, such as reserve networks, must consider the tension between these two processes and reach a balance between distances near enough to maintain connectivity, but far enough to benefit from risk spreading. Here, we model this trade-off. We show how two measures of metapopulation persistence depend on the shape of the dispersal kernel and the shape of the distance decay in demographic covariance, and we consider the implications of this trade-off for reserve spacing. The relative rates of distance decay in dispersal and demographic covariance determine whether the long-run metapopulation growth rate, and quasi-extinction risk, peak for adjacent patches or intermediately spaced patches; two local maxima in metapopulation. persistence are also possible. When dispersal itself fluctuates over time, the trade-off changes. Temporal variation in mean distance that propagules are dispersed (i.e., propagule advection) decreases metapopulation persistence and decreases the likelihood that persistence will peak for adjacent patches. Conversely, variation in diffusion (the extent of random spread around mean dispersal) increases metapopulation persistence overall and causes it to peak at shorter inter-patch distances. Thus, failure to consider temporal variation in dispersal processes increases the risk that reserve spacings will fail to meet the objective of ensuring metapopulation persistence. This study identifies two phenomena that receive relatively little attention in empirical work on reserve spacing, but that can qualitatively change the effectiveness of reserve spacing strategies: (1) the functional form of the distance decay in covariance among patch-specific demographic rates and (2) temporal variation in the shape of the dispersal kernel. The sensitivity of metapopulation recovery and persistence to how covariance of vital rates decreases with distance suggests that estimating the shape of this function is likely to be as important for effective reserve design as estimating connectivity. Similarly, because temporal variation in dispersal dynamics influences the effect of reserve spacing, approaches to reserve design that ignore such variation, and rely instead on long-term average dispersal patterns, are likely to lead to lower metapopulation viability than is actually achievable.",,,,,"Blowes, Shane/KHD-9644-2024; Connolly, Sean/E-7773-2011","Blowes, Shane/0000-0001-6310-3670; Connolly, Sean/0000-0003-1537-0859",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,JAN,2012,22,1,,,,,311,321,,10.1890/11-0952.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-0952.1,,,,,,,,22471092,,,,,WOS:000301095600023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Population variability, relative to population size, was assayed by regressing the standard deviation of population size against mean population size. Linear regression produced slopes that were less than one in 165 of 203 species. Thus, temporal fluctuations in population size became significantly weaker as population size increased. Similarly, the slope was significantly less than one for a single regression including all 2387 populations, regardless of taxonomic classification. The slopes of the regression lines did not differ for major taxonomic groupings, but the Y-intercept was significantly lower for birds than for the other taxonomic groupings. Factor analysis was used to examine the highly correlated parameters: data reliability, population size and taxonomic lineage. Population size was obviously the most important parameter affecting temporal variation in population size, data reliability was also very important, but taxonomy was of little or no importance. The relationship between temporal variation in population size and mean population size, predicted from the data, was used to predict the probability of extinction assuming a normal distribution of population sizes.

This study examines the early phase of an outbreak that was developing across a 268,000 km(2) area over a period of 9 years (2003-2011). The territory was subdivided in 225 km(2) cells, and the relative influence of forest composition, elevation, forest age, average degree-days and soil drainage were examined during three development phases of the outbreak: initial epicenter location, relatively long-distance spread (cell-to-cell expansion), and expansion inside individual cells (within-cell expansion). The results indicate that elevation is the most determinant variable for initial epicenter location. Other variables that were identified as important for outbreak development by previous studies, such as forest composition and average degree-days, were not so important during this phase. However, forest composition and average degree-days were important factors during the cell-to-cell and within-cell expansion phases. Separating outbreak development in distinct phases also allowed to integrate phase-specific spatial and temporal covariates that were highly significant in the models, such as distance from previous year defoliations during the cell-to-cell expansion phase, and the proportion of defoliated stands during the preceding year for the within-cell expansion phase. Overall, this study provides limited evidence that patterns of SBW outbreak expansion could be altered by reducing host tree species abundance in the forest [mainly balsam fir (Abies balsamea) in this region]. More generally, this study suggests that the influence of environmental variables on SBW outbreak development is clearly phase-dependent, and that this landscape-level, process-based approach could be useful to forecast insect outbreak development in forest ecosystems.",,,,,"AUGER, ISABELLE/P-6294-2016","AUGER, ISABELLE/0000-0002-1414-8095; Bouchard, Mathieu/0000-0003-0261-3153",,,,,,,,,,,,,0921-2973,1572-9761,,,,JAN,2014,29,1,,,,,111,126,,10.1007/s10980-013-9966-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-013-9966-x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000330827600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Next, managers must recognize that it is practically impossible to use population suppression to prevent outbreaks that extend over large geographic regions. Silvicultural practices can sometimes be effective at reducing forest susceptibility to outbreaks but these methods should be based on sound science. Many of the most damaging forest pests are non-native species and minimizing the invasion problem is most effective when steps are taken early on in the invasion process.

One small cluster in northeastern Ontario stood out as anomalous, as a result of an increasing trend in the duration of periodic defoliation episodes, marked by an unprecedented double-wave of defoliation that persisted from 1992 to 1999. This is the precise area where, in the early 2000s, trembling aspen Populus tremuloides stems were mapped as being in a state of decline of unprecedented severity and extent.

We analyzed time series of the abundance of ten species of spring foliage feeding Lepidoptera sampled over a 25-year period at 20 sites in the Slovak Republic. Six species were free-feeders and four were leaf-rollers as larvae. Twenty-nine percent of interspecific pairs were significantly synchronous and correlations were highest among species exhibiting similar feeding strategies. Similar patterns of interspecific synchrony have been previously demonstrated in several other taxa, and the synchronizing effects of weather and/or specialist predators have been proposed as mechanisms. As an alternative explanation, we explored a model in which two species within the same feeding guild were synchronized by the functional response of generalist predators. In this model, species remained unsynchronized in the complete absence of predation or when predatory pressures were applied to only one species. Pairs of prey species projecting relatively similar search images to predators were more highly synchronized than species with relatively different search images. Prey handling time only influenced synchrony when it was very high relative to the total time prey was exposed to predators. Our model's prediction of greater synchrony among species that project similar search images to predators was in agreement with our field study that showed greater synchrony among species sharing similar larval feeding strategies and morphologies.",,,,,"Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,DEC,2004,107,3,,,,,462,470,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13449.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13449.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000225266600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climatic effects are increasingly being recognised as an important factor causing inter-annual variability in organism abundances in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. This study investigated the relationships between water temperature (cumulative degree-days > 12 degrees C), river discharge (cumulative discharge-days above basal discharge rate), the position of the North Wall of the Gulf Stream (NWGS), and the 0+ growth (September mean length) and recruitment success (year-class strength, YCS) of three species of cyprinid fishes in two contrasting English lowland rivers, using a 21-year dataset. 2. Contrary to the majority of studies on 0+ fishes, growth in the Yorkshire Ouse was most significantly correlated with river discharge, with water temperature of less importance. By contrast, temperature was more influential than discharge in the River Trent, possibly because of its regulated hydrological regime, although none of the relationships were statistically significant for this river. 3. Year-class strength of roach (Rutilus rutilus) was positively correlated with the position of the NWGS, and there was evidence of synchrony in recruitment success between rivers, but the relationships were poorer for chub (Leuciscus cephalus) and dace (Leuciscus leuciscus). The strongest relationships between YCS and discharge during specific time periods were for when the fish were in their early (especially larval) developmental stages, although none of the relationships were statistically significant because of inter-annual variations in river discharge relative to the timing of fish hatching. 4. Fishes are key predators in the majority of aquatic ecosystems and, as such, fluctuations in their abundances can have implications for ecosystem functioning as a whole. This study has demonstrated an underlying influence of broad-scale climatic effects on the recruitment of riverine fishes, in spite of local variations in biotic and abiotic conditions. The relative importance of various abiotic factors on the recruitment success of riverine cyprinid populations varies spatially and temporally. For example, river discharge is likely to be of relatively greater importance in poorly-structured rivers or those that are prone to large and rapid fluctuations in flow, while temporal variations occur because of inter-annual differences in river discharge relative to the timing of fish hatching. Biotic factors may also be important determinants of fish recruitment success, especially in rivers with stable and predictable flow regimes.",,,,,"Cowx, Ian/A-5540-2009; Nunn, Andy D./J-6341-2017; Britton, Robert/B-5040-2009","Nunn, Andy D./0000-0001-8370-1221; Britton, Robert/0000-0003-1853-3086",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,AUG,2007,52,8,,,,,1576,1586,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01789.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01789.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000247905900014,View Full Record in Web of Science

During outbreak years they cause severe defoliation in many forest stands in Europe. In order to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics and elucidate possible influences of weather, stand and site conditions, a generalized additive mixed model was developed. The investigated data base was derived from glue band catch monitoring stands of both species in Central and North Germany. From the glue bands only female moth individuals are counted and a hazard code is calculated. The model can be employed to predict the exceedance of a warning threshold of this hazard code which indicates a potential severe defoliation of oak stands by winter moth and mottled umber in the coming spring. Results: The developed model accounts for specific temporal structured effects for three large ecoregions and random effects at stand level. During variable selection the negative model effect of pest control and the positive model effects of mean daily minimum temperature in adult stage and precipitation in early pupal stage were identified. Conclusion: The developed model can be used for short-term predictions of potential defoliation risk in Central and North Germany. These predictions are sensitive to weather conditions and the population dynamics.

We show different synchronization dynamics governed by both period mismatch and dispersal in neighboring patches. Indeed, we find both appearance and disappearance of phase synchronization, quasiperiodic oscillations, and period doubling of limit cycle. We also quantify the effect of seasonal variation (entrainment) and dispersal on species synchrony using phase-response curve and a synchrony measure, which thereof identify the influence of stochasticity on species persistence through trade-off mechanisms.

However, few attempts have been made to examine synchrony for phytoplankton fluctuations among different habitats in a single reservoir system. The present study employed Spearman rank correlation analysis and the Mantel test to assess levels of synchrony for phytoplankton abundance and taxonomic composition from reservoir mainstream to a tributary bay (Xiangxi Bay) in a giant dendritic reservoir, China (Three Gorges Reservoir, TGR). At the selected scale, asynchronous patterns of phytoplankton were found when looking at total abundance and taxonomic composition, suggesting that regional drivers were not strong enough to synchronize phytoplankton fluctuations, and local regulators were predominant. As a riverine system, the mainstream of TGR had high levels of algal synchrony, while asynchronous patterns of phytoplankton were detected within Xiangxi Bay, which is characterized as a lacustrine system. The present study further confirmed that external hydrological disturbances strongly homogenize habitat conditions and synchronize phytoplankton fluctuations within the mainstream, while spatial divergence of phytoplankton succession depend on local habitat conditions within Xiangxi Bay. Moreover, low synchrony of phytoplankton between the mainstream and Xiangxi Bay is probably caused by spatial divergence of phytoplankton succession within Xiangxi Bay and the lack of succession in the rapidly flushed mainstream. Independently of these mechanisms possibly explaining phytoplankton fluctuations, the present study has also an applied perspective to the improvement of a long-term observation program in which phytoplankton trends at the mainstream scale could be compiled from the data set in a single site, while a set of sampling sites should be required at the Xiangxi Bay scale.",,,,,"XU, Yaoyang/J-9809-2012; Cai, Qinghua/F-8176-2015","Cai, Qinghua/0000-0002-0224-7256",,,,,,,,,,,,,1015-1621,1420-9055,,,,APR,2012,74,2,,,,,287,300,,10.1007/s00027-011-0221-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-011-0221-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000302518900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate and weather conditions influence beetle population dynamics, and managers and policymakers are concerned about the potential effects of climate change on outbreaks. Here we studied five locations with extensive outbreaks in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests across the western United States. Using observations and modeling, we quantified means and changes relative to prior years of three climate or weather factors associated with outbreaks: (1) year-round temperatures that affect adaptive seasonality; (2) low temperatures that induce mortality of overwintering beetles; and (3) drought stress of host trees. Climate variable means varied among locations, indicating the beetle's tolerance to different climate during outbreaks. Analyses of climate or weather factors as outbreaks progressed revealed that year-round temperatures during outbreaks were typically higher than in prior years, and outbreak years lacked very low winter temperatures that often occurred in prior years. Drought was present at each location during some time of an outbreak, and increases in beetle-caused tree mortality at lower beetle population levels (as indicated by killed trees) were usually coincident with drought. Furthermore, drought was not required to maintain large outbreaks; in several locations, relief from drought during periods of high tree mortality did not cause subsequent declines in tree mortality. We did not find strong evidence that maladaptive seasonality, cold-induced mortality, or drought stress was responsible for decreases in tree mortality, suggesting the role of host depletion. Large variability in the relationships between climate or weather variables and outbreaks suggests that different climate and weather factors may have been limiting outbreaks at different times and that these factors did not influence beetle-caused tree mortality similarly among locations. Our results increase understanding of the climate and weather factors that influence beetle outbreaks and their variability in space and time and will lead to more accurate predictions of future patterns of outbreaks that consider future climate.

Recent theoretical and empirical studies of sourcesink systems demonstrate that temporally variable local growth rates in sinks can substantially increase average abundance of a persisting population, provided that the variation is positively autocorrelated in effect, temporal variation inflates average abundance. Here we extend these results to a metapopulation in which all habitat patches are sinks. Using numerical studies of a population with discrete generations ( buttressed by analytic results), we show that temporal variation and moderate dispersal can jointly permit indefinite persistence of the metapopulation and that positive autocorrelation both lowers the magnitude of variation required for persistence and increases the average abundance of persisting metapopulations. These effects are weakened - but not destroyed - if variation in local growth rates is spatially synchronized and dispersal is localized. We show that the inflationary effect is robust to a number of extensions of the basic model, including demographic stochasticity and density dependence. Because ecological and environmental processes contributing to temporally variable growth rates in natural populations are typically autocorrelated, these observations may have important implications for species persistence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,AUG,2005,166,2,,,,,246,261,,10.1086/431286,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/431286,,,,,,,,16032577,,,,,WOS:000230721200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

But these associations are not transparent, and the relative importance of these and other factors for TL slope variation is poorly studied. TL is thus a ubiquitously used indicator in ecology, the understanding of which is still opaque. The goal of this study was to provide tools to help fill this gap in understanding by providing proximate determinants of TL slopes, statistical quantities that are correlated to TL slopes but are simpler than the slope itself and are more readily linked to ecological factors. Using numeric simulations and 82 multi-decadal population datasets, we here propose, test and apply two proximate statistical determinants of TL slopes which we argue can become key tools for understanding the nature and ecological causes of TL slope variation. We find that measures based on population skewness, coefficient of variation and synchrony are effective proximate determinants.

We used an experimental model system based on the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and its algal prey Chlorella vulgaris. We constructed temporal prey fluctuations with two periodic components that matched the generation time and life span of the rotifer. By varying the amplitude of these two periods we created prey variability with white (both periods had equal power) and red (the longest period had greatest power) spectra. In the absence of dispersal only the red fluctuations induced synchrony in the population dynamics of the rotifer. Dispersal had a strong and rapid synchronizing effect. The combination of red (but not white) fluctuations and dispersal resulted in the highest levels of synchrony.

Feedbacks among plant enemies can have large effects on host population and disease dynamics, either by promoting stabilizing negative feedbacks or contributing to positive feedbacks that can destabilize populations and permit outbreaks. Feedbacks can be rapid and direct (e.g. within trees or among years) or can arise from slowly developing changes in host resource quantity or quality at the scale of forest stands or landscapes. Climate may also influence system dynamics by altering feedbacks within or among species or through density independent effects. We evaluated major drivers of population dynamics of beech bark disease (BBD), an important forest disease in eastern deciduous forests of North America, using data from 28 study sites in the eastern United States monitored for up to 14 yr between 1979 and 1992. Both primary causal agents of BBD the introduced felted beech scale Cryptococcus fagisuga and native fungi Neonectria spp. showed strong simple density dependence in all study populations. Surprisingly, densities of scale insects and fungi had little or no effects on population growth rates of the other, despite their habit of living in close physical relationships. For both insects and fungi, ecologically important features of the density dependent functions (slope, carrying capacity and density independent variance) were variable across sites. Climatic effects on density-dependent functions (and scatter around them) were evident but generally weak and variable. The most striking predictor of patterns in density dependence was duration since establishment of BBD in the region.

The mean field description assumes that the individuals are homogeneously mixed and interact with one another with equal probability, so that space can be ignored. In the spatial model, on the other hand, predators can prey only in a certain neighborhood of their spatial location. We show that the size of these predation neighborhoods has dramatic effects on the dynamics and on the organization of the species in space. In the case of a three species food chain, in particular, the populations of predators display a sequence of apparently irregular outbreaks when the predation neighborhood has intermediate values, as compared to the size of the available space. Nonetheless, further increasing their size makes the outbreaks disappear and the dynamics approach that of the mean field model.

This synchrony is often attributed to the Moran effect, that is, shared environmental fluctuations across the region. In this article, I use a series of simple metapopulation models to show that the degree of synchrony among populations separated by different distances is strongly affected by the particular way that environmental stochasticity is represented in the models. Furthermore, when multiple types of stochasticity are acting simultaneously, the synchronizing effect of any one type is difficult to discern from the resulting pattern of population synchrony. These effects can be exacerbated under certain demographic conditions or if population dynamics are affected by interspecific interactions. In general, it should be extremely difficult to determine if synchrony is caused by the Moran effect using only the synchrony-distance relationship of natural populations.",,,,,,"Abbott, Karen/0000-0001-5143-0690",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,JUN,2007,116,6,,,,,903,912,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15856.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15856.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000246435000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Often tests of metacommunity models rely on snapshot patterns of species distribution and abundance. Such patterns may introduce biases because they overlook differences in responses of constituent species to changing environmental conditions, particularly when such responses override patterns predicted from dispersal and biotic interactions alone. This applies, for example, to habitat generalists, whose responses to environmental variations differ from those of habitat specialists, resulting in different snapshot patterns at different times. Synchronized (i.e., correlated among sites) environmental variation is perhaps the most obvious case of environmental variation that could generate regular differences among species of different specialization. We hypothesized that synchronized environmental variation synchronizes local populations of habitat specialists to a greater degree than it does for habitat generalists as experiments have shown that habitat generalists are less sensitive to changing environmental conditions. To test this in an empirical system, we used time series data (nine annual surveys) on an invertebrate metacommunity of 49 rock pools on the coast of Jamaica. We found that population synchrony of a significant portion of 24 species sharing these rock pools increased with habitat specialization in response to environmental synchrony (represented by synchrony of environment). However, distance among rock pools, which may affect dispersal or shared perturbations, was negatively correlated with population synchrony of individual species, irrespective of their specialization. As only habitat specialists showed increasing synchrony with environmental synchrony, and both generalist and specialist synchrony were negatively correlated with distance, we infer that habitat generalists must be synchronized more by space-related processes while habitat specialists by a combination of environmental forcing and dispersal. Overall, the study suggests that species of different habitat specialization show consistent differences with respect to local processes involving environmental variations but show fewer differences with respect to regional processes involving distance, at least when long-term dynamics are concerned. Furthermore, the study identifies a rarely recognized link between variation in space and its consequences for variation in time-a link much more expressed among spatially restricted species such as habitat specialists.",,,,,"Enders, Eva/G-9804-2019","Enders, Eva/0000-0003-2103-0359; Kolasa, Jurek/0000-0003-0910-8950",,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,MAY,2016,7,5,,,,,,,e01217,10.1002/ecs2.1217,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1217,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000377215200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

For example, an important biotic factor for herbivores in northern ecosystems is the availability of winter food. If the food availability changes because of the changing climate, it likely has major impact on the abundance of herbivores. To evaluate this, we need to know the relative roles of weather and biotic interactions, such as food availability and risk of predation, for the species. Here, we utilize long-term data on nest-box occupancy by Siberian flying squirrels (Pteromys volans) in Finland during 2002-2018. We built binary models with nest-box occupancy in different seasons as a response variable. Weather, winter food (tree mast), and predator presence (the Ural owl, Strix uralensis) modified seasonal nest-box occupancy patterns of the flying squirrel. However, the effect of weather was only important in the summer. The negative effect of predators was clear for adults but, surprisingly, not for overwinter survival of apparent juveniles. Considering the relative importance of different factors, winter food availability had a clear positive effect in each season. Our study supports the view that the effects of climate change mediate through multiple biotic interactions.

These disturbances produced synchronous fluctuations in forest characteristics over large spatial scales. In this paper, we review possible responses of flora and fauna to pulsed large-scale disturbance events and speculate on whether they should be emulated to reduce the impacts of forest management on non-timber resources. The importance of large-scale disturbance pulses for biodiversity and forest ecosystem integrity is potentially great, but this aspect has been poorly investigated by previous research, and thus there is little information available to guide forest management. Large-scale, synchronous disturbances could be emulated by clustering harvesting activities in time, for example by creating harvest pulses of 10-20 years, separated by periods of 50100 years or so with low harvest rates. A potential disadvantage of this strategy is that when our capacity to predict future natural disturbances is low, there is a higher probability of accidentally taking the forest ecosystem outside of the range of natural variability compared with a status quo forest management scenario. From a socio-economic perspective, another potential disadvantage is in creating irregular wood flows to the forest transformation industry. Nonetheless, in a context where the forest has been over-disturbed in the recent past, a forest management strategy involving fluctuating harvest rates could provide the means for faster ecosystem recovery compared with a status quo strategy. We recommend that the potential importance of disturbance pulses for boreal and sub-boreal ecosystems be more thoroughly investigated by future research to inform management and conservation policies.

Specifically, we determine the extent to which ocean climate conditions and Cassin's Auklet timing of breeding and breeding success covary across populations in British Columbia, central California, and northern Mexico over six years (2000-2005) and test whether auklet timing of breeding and breeding success are similarly related to local and large-scale ocean climate indices across populations. Local ocean foraging environments ranged from seasonally variable, high-productivity environments in the north to aseasonal, low-productivity environments to the south, but covaried similarly due to the synchronizing effects of large-scale climate processes. Auklet timing of breeding in the southern population did not covary with populations to the north and was not significantly related to local oceanographic conditions, in contrast to northern populations, where timing of breeding appears to be influenced by oceanographic cues that signal peaks in prey availability. Annual breeding success covaried similarly across populations and was consistently related to local ocean climate conditions across this system. Overall, local ocean climate indices, particularly sea surface height, better explained timing of breeding and breeding success than a large-scale climate index by better representing heterogeneity in physical processes important to auklets and their prey. The significant, consistent relationships we detected between Cassin's Auklet breeding success and ocean climate conditions across widely spaced populations indicate that Cassin's Auklets are susceptible to climate change across the California Current System, especially by the strengthening of climate processes that synchronize oceanographic conditions. Auklet populations in the northern and central regions of this ecosystem may be more sensitive to changes in the timing and variability of ocean climate conditions since they appear to time breeding to take advantage of seasonal productivity peaks.",,,,,,"sydeman, william/0000-0003-1902-4654; Wolf, Shaye Gabrielle/0009-0008-2490-7439",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,MAR,2009,90,3,,,,,742,753,,10.1890/07-1267.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-1267.1,,,,,,,,19341144,,,,,WOS:000263776800015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Forest carbon (C) dynamics in these ecosystems are affected during insect outbreaks because millions of square kilometers of forest suffer growth loss and mortality. We tested the hypothesis that a spruce budworm outbreak similar to those in the past could switch a forest from a C sink to a source in the near future. We used a model of ecosystem C to integrate past spruce budworm impact sequences with current forest management data on 106,000 km(2) of forest in eastern Qu,bec. Spruce budworm-caused mortality decreased stand-level merchantable C stocks by 11-90% and decreased ecosystem C stocks by 2-10% by the end of the simulation. For the first 13 years (2011-2024), adding spruce budworm significantly reduced ecosystem C stock change for the landscape from a sink (4.6 +/- A 2.7 g C m(-2) y(-1) in 2018) to a source (-16.8 +/- A 3.0 g C m(-2) y(-1) in 2018). This result was mostly due to reduced net primary production. The ecosystem stock change was reduced on average by 2 Tg C y(-1) for the entire simulated area. This study provides the first estimate that spruce budworm can significantly affect the C sink or source status of a large landscape.

A central question in ecology is to separate the relative contribution of density dependence and stochastic influences to annual fluctuations in population size. Here we estimate the deterministic and stochastic components of the dynamics of different European populations of white stork Ciconia ciconia. We then examined whether annual changes in population size was related to the climate during the breeding period (the 'tap hypothesis'sensu S ae ther, Sutherland & Engen (2004, Advances in Ecological Research, 35, 185-209) or during the nonbreeding period, especially in the winter areas in Africa (the 'tube hypothesis'). 2. A general characteristic of the population dynamics of this long-distance migrant is small environmental stochasticity and strong density regulation around the carrying capacity with short return times to equilibrium. 3. Annual changes in the size of the eastern European populations were correlated by rainfall in the wintering areas in Africa as well as local weather in the breeding areas just before arrival and in the later part of the breeding season and regional climate variation (North Atlantic Oscillation). This indicates that weather influences the population fluctuations of white storks through losses of sexually mature individuals as well as through an effect on the number of individuals that manages to establish themselves in the breeding population. Thus, both the tap and tube hypothesis explains climate influences on white stork population dynamics. 4. The spatial scale of environmental noise after accounting for the local dynamics was 67 km, suggesting that the strong density dependence reduces the synchronizing effects of climate variation on the population dynamics of white stork. 5. Several climate variables reduced the synchrony of the residual variation in population size after accounting for density dependence and demographic stochasticity, indicating that these climate variables had a synchronizing effect on the population fluctuations. In contrast, other climatic variables acted as desynchronizing agents. 6.

The frequency and nature of precipitation events are also predicted to change in the future. These changes in climate are expected, together with increasing human pressures, to have significant impacts on Arctic and sub-Arctic species and ecosystems. Due to the key role that reindeer play in those ecosystems, it is essential to understand how climate will affect the region's most important species. Our study assesses the role of climate on the dynamics of fourteen Eurasian reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) populations, using for the first time data on reindeer abundance collected over a 70-year period, including both wild and semi-domesticated reindeer, and covering more than half of the species' total range. We analyzed trends in population dynamics, investigated synchrony among population growth rates, and assessed the effects of climate on population growth rates. Trends in the population dynamics were remarkably heterogeneous. Synchrony was apparent only among some populations and was not correlated with distance among population ranges. Proxies of climate variability mostly failed to explain population growth rates and synchrony. For both wild and semi-domesticated populations, local weather, biotic pressures, loss of habitat and human disturbances appear to have been more important drivers of reindeer population dynamics than climate. In semi-domesticated populations, management strategies may have masked the effects of climate. Conservation efforts should aim to mitigate human disturbances, which could exacerbate the potentially negative effects of climate change on reindeer populations in the future.

Recent incursion into the jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) of northwestern Alberta threatens further range expansion through the boreal forest to central and eastern Canada. The spread from British Columbia into northwestern Alberta has been facilitated by above-canopy dispersal of the insect by meso-scale atmospheric currents.

This large-amplitude oscillation often de-stabilises multispecies communities and increases the chances of species extinction. What mechanisms help species in a complex ecological system to persist? Some studies show that dispersal can stabilise an ecological community and permit multi-species coexistence. However, previous empirical and theoretical studies often focused on one- or two-species systems, and in real life, we have more than two-species coexisting together in nature. Here, we employ a (four-species) multiple interactions type model to investigate how competition interacts with other biotic factors and dispersal to shape multi-species communities. Our results reveal that dispersal has (de-)stabilising effects on the formation of multi-species communities, and this phenomenon shapes coexistence mechanisms of interacting species. These contrasting effects of dispersal can best be illustrated through its combined influences with the competition. To do this, we employ numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis techniques to track the stable and unstable attractors of the system. Results show the presence of Hopf bifurcations, transcritical bifurcations, period-doubling bifurcations and limit point bifurcations of cycles as we vary the competitive strength in the system. Furthermore, our bifurcation analysis findings show that stable coexistence of multiple species is possible for some threshold values of ecologically-relevant parameters in this complex system.

By looking at synchrony in plant productivity over 18 yr across two elevations in three types of coastal marsh habitat dominated by different clonal plant species in Georgia, USA, we were able to explore the importance of plant species and different habitat conditions to synchrony. Synchrony was highest when comparing within a plant species and within a marsh zone, and decreased across species, with increasing distance, and with increasing elevational differences. Abiotic conditions that were measured at individual sites (water column temperature and salinity) also showed high synchrony among sites, and in one case (salinity) decreased with increasing distance among sites. The Moran effect (synchronous abiotic conditions among sites) is the most plausible explanation for our findings. Decreased synchrony between creekbank and mid-marsh zones, and among habitat types (tidal fresh, brackish, and salt marsh) was likely due in part to different exposure to abiotic conditions and in part to variation in sensitivity of dominant plant species to these abiotic conditions. We found no evidence for asynchrony among species, sites or zones, indicating that one habitat type or zone will not compensate for poor production in another during years with low productivity; however, tidal fresh, brackish. and salt marsh sites were also not highly synchronous with each other, which will moderate productivity variation among years at the landscape level due to the portfolio effect. We identified the creekbank zone as more sensitive than the mid-marsh to abiotic variation and therefore as a priority for monitoring and management.",,,,,"Pennings, Steven/A-8326-2013; Liu, Wenwen/KYP-9583-2024","Pennings, Steven/0000-0003-4757-7125",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,MAR,2021,102,3,,,,,,,e03278,10.1002/ecy.3278,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3278,,FEB 2021,,,,,,33370500,,,,,WOS:000616821700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

If species' populations fluctuate asynchronously, the risk of their simultaneous extinction is low, thus reducing the species' regional extinction risk. However, identifying synchronizing or desynchronizing mechanisms in systems containing several species and when perturbations affect multiple species is challenging. We propose a metacommunity model consisting of two food chains connected by dispersal to study the transmission of small perturbations affecting populations in the vicinity of an equilibrium. In spite of the complex responses produced by such a system, two elements enable us to understand the key processes that rule the synchrony between populations: (1) knowing which species have the strongest response to perturbations and (2) the relative importance of dispersal processes compared with local dynamics for each species. We show that perturbing a species in one patch can lead to asynchrony between patches if the perturbed species is not the most affected by dispersal. The synchrony patterns of rare species are the most sensitive to the relative strength of dispersal to demographic processes, thus making biomass distribution critical to understanding the response of trophic metacommunities to perturbations. We further partition the effect of each perturbation on species synchrony when perturbations affect multiple trophic levels. Our approach allows disentangling and predicting the responses of simple trophic metacommunities to perturbations, thus providing a theoretical foundation for future studies considering more complex spatial ecological systems.",,,,,,"Barbier, Matthieu/0000-0002-0669-8927",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,JUN 1,2021,197,6,,,,,E188,E203,,10.1086/714131,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714131,,JUN 2021,,,,,,33989141,,,,,WOS:000641129500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we test this assumption by deriving a phase model from two weakly coupled predator-prey oscillators and analyze the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the phase dynamics of this system.

The study was based on census data and environmental variables collected every fourth month over 1986-2006 at 12 sites selected along four Rio Esva tributaries (northwestern Spain). Density-dependent hypotheses involving the operation of current and lagged densities on recruitment and subsequent spawner density were analyzed at three increasingly larger geographical scales (site, stream, and river drainage). No evidence supported these hypotheses, suggesting an overall lack of negative feedbacks among year classes. Stream discharge in March when trout emerge and site depth explained substantial amounts of spatiotemporal variation in recruitment. The effects of these two factors on recruitment were sufficiently strong to be detected in year-class mortality and subsequent spawner density. Discharge and site depth determine the amount of spatial habitat suitable for sized individuals during their lifetime and, hence, the maximum number of individuals across space and time. Recruitment dependence, as a delayed density-dependent factor, adjusts the numbers in excess to the numbers established by spatial habitat.

Dispersal plays a pivotal role in maintaining diversity in spatially subdivided communities, but only a few experiments have simultaneously investigated how dispersal and environmental fluctuation affect community dynamics and ecosystem stability. We performed an experimental study using marine phytoplankton species as model organisms to test these mechanisms in a metacommunity context. We established three levels of dispersal and exposed the phytoplankton to fluctuating light levels, where fluctuations were either spatially asynchronous or synchronous across patches of the metacommunity. Dispersal had no effect on diversity and ecosystem function (biomass), while light fluctuations affected both evenness and community biomass. The temporal variability of community biomass was reduced by fluctuating light and temporal beta diversity was influenced interactively by dispersal and fluctuation, whereas spatial variability in community biomass and beta diversity were barely affected by treatments. Along the establishing gradient of species richness and dominance, community biomass increased but temporal variability of biomass decreased, thus highest stability was associated with species-rich but highly uneven communities and less influenced by compensatory dynamics.

More recently, growing efforts are devoted to examine the C-M patterns and process for invasive species partly due to their relatively short history, highly dynamic populations, and management implications. Here I examine recent findings and information gaps related to (1) the C-M population dynamics linked to species invasions, and (2) the possible effects of climate change and land use on the C-M patterns and processes. Unlike most native species that are relatively stable (some even having contracting populations or ranges), many invasive species are still spreading fast and form new distribution or abundance centers. Because of the strong nonlinearity of population demographic or vital rates (i.e., birth, death, immigration, and emigration) across the C-M gradients and the increased complexity of species ranges due to habitat fragmentation, multiple introductions, range-wide C-M comparisons and simulation involving multiple vital rates are needed in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,,2014,2,,,,,,,,23,10.3389/fevo.2014.00023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2014.00023,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000517755700022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Predation and mutualism are among the most prevalent biotic interactions in the multi-species system. Several ecological studies exist, but they are based on one-or two-species interactions, and in real life, multiple interactions are natural characteristics of a multi-species community. Here, we use a system of partial differential equations to study the combined effects of predation, mutualism and dispersal on the multi-species coexistence and community stability in the ecological system. Our results show that predation provided a defensive mechanism against the negative consequences of the multiple species interactions by reducing the net effect of competition. Predation is critical in the stability and coexistence of the multi-species community. The combined effects of predation and dispersal enhance the multiple species coexistence and persistence. Dispersal exerts a positive effect on the system by supporting multiple species coexistence and stability of community structures. Dispersal process also reduces the adverse effects associated with multiple species interactions. Additionally, mutualism induces oscillatory behaviour on the system through Hopf bifurcation. The roles of mutualism also support multiple species coexistence mechanisms (for some threshold values) by increasing the stable coexistence and the stable limit cycle regions. We discover that the stability and coexistence mechanisms are controlled by the transcritical and Hopf bifurcation that occurs in this system.

Here, we introduce the concept of structural synchrony, defined as the coherence of structural variations in multispecies assemblages occurring at a certain spatiotemporal scale, and propose a direct measure of this type of synchrony. This approach was first tested on numeric simulations imitating various types of model community dynamics and then applied to a large data set on White Sea intertidal harpacticoids, covering a wide range of spatial (decimeters to 140 m) and temporal (days to 25 yr) scales. Scale-specific analysis revealed distinct patterns and allowed us to draw inferences about processes that drive community dynamics. Short-term (up to 1 mo) changes occurred independently or even anti-synchronically, possibly due to trophic-driven migrations. On a seasonal scale, a high degree of within-habitat synchrony occurred at time intervals of 2-3 mo or longer but dropped with increasing spatial distance; this pattern is most likely caused by seasonal reproductive dynamics of populations. At the interannual scale, external exposure, i.e. long-term changes in sediment composition, appeared to be the strongest synchronizing force for the harpacticoid community, while this factor was locally active and became most apparent at the within-habitat scale. We evaluate the advantages and limitations of our framework, highlighting its broad domain of application and anticipating potential extensions. We encourage ecologists to integrate structural synchrony analysis into their toolbox to quantitatively evaluate spatiotemporal community dynamics and to link these dynamics with underlying processes.",,,,,"Garlitska, Lesya/AAD-3308-2019; Azovsky, Andrey/B-4773-2018",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,OCT 6,2022,698,,,,,,55,68,,10.3354/meps14159,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps14159,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000867506900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Silviculture Hypothesis first arose in the 1920s, with the idea that outbreaks were driven by forestry practices favoring susceptible softwood species. In the 1960s, it was proposed that populations were governed by Multiple Equilibria, with warm weather conditions releasing low-density populations from the regulatory control of natural enemies. Dispersal from outbreak foci, or epicenters, was seen as causing widespread outbreaks that eventually collapsed following resource depletion. However, in the 1980s, following the re-analysis of data from the 1940s outbreak in New Brunswick, this interpretation was challenged. The alternative Oscillatory Hypothesis proposed that budworm population dynamics were governed by a second-order density-dependent process, with oscillations being driven by natural enemy-victim interactions. Under this hypothesis, weather and resource availability contribute to secondary fluctuations around the main oscillation, and weather and moth dispersal serve to synchronize population cycles regionally. Intensive, independent population studies during the peak and declining phases of the 1980s outbreak supported the principal tenet of the Oscillatory Hypothesis, but concluded that host plant quality played a more important role than this hypothesis proposed. More recent research on the early phase of spruce budworm cycles suggests that mate-finding and natural-enemy-driven Allee effects in low-density populations might be overcome by immigration of moths, which can facilitate the onset of outbreaks. Even more recent research has supported components of all three hypotheses attempting to explain spruce budworm dynamics. In the midst of a new rising outbreak (2006-present), we discuss the evolution of debates surrounding these hypotheses from a historic perspective, examine gaps in current knowledge, and suggest avenues for future research (e. g., intensive studies on low-density populations) to better understand and manage spruce budworm populations.",,,,,"Heard, Stephen/C-2737-2012; Pureswaran, Deepa/G-8074-2019; Johns, Robert/G-7326-2011","Pureswaran, Deepa/0000-0002-4040-7708",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,DEC,2016,45,6,,,,,1333,1342,,10.1093/ee/nvw103,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvw103,,,,,,,,28028079,,,,,WOS:000392943900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Geographic gradients in population dynamics may occur because of spatial variation in resources that affect the deterministic components of the dynamics (i.e. carrying capacity, the specific growth rate at small densities or the strength of density regulation) or because of spatial variation in the effects of environmental stochasticity. To evaluate these, we used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate parameters characterizing deterministic components and stochastic influences on population dynamics of eight species of ducks (mallard, northern pintail, blue-winged teal, gadwall, northern shoveler, American wigeon, canvasback and redhead (Anas platyrhynchos, A. acuta, A. discors, A. strepera, A. clypeata, A. americana, Aythya valisineria and Ay. americana, respectively) breeding in the North American prairies, and then tested whether these parameters varied latitudinally. 2. We also examined the influence of temporal variation in the availability of wetlands, spring temperature and winter precipitation on population dynamics to determine whether geographical gradients in population dynamics were related to large-scale variation in environmental effects. Population variability, as measured by the variance of the population fluctuations around the carrying capacity K, decreased with latitude for all species except canvasback. This decrease in population variability was caused by a combination of latitudinal gradients in the strength of density dependence, carrying capacity and process variance, for which details varied by species. 3. The effects of environmental covariates on population dynamics also varied latitudinally, particularly for mallard, northern pintail and northern shoveler. However, the proportion of the process variance explained by environmental covariates, with the exception of mallard, tended to be small. 4. Thus, geographical gradients in population dynamics of prairie ducks resulted from latitudinal gradients in both deterministic and stochastic components, and were likely influenced by spatial differences in the distribution of wetland types and shapes, agricultural practices and dispersal processes. 5.

Our synthesis brings together theory and empirical evidence for how habitat connectivity affects both food web stability and complexity. Food web stability is often predicted to be greatest at intermediate levels of connectivity, representing a compromise between the stabilizing effects of dispersal via rescue effects and prey switching, and the destabilizing effects of dispersal via regional synchronization of population dynamics. Empirical studies of food web stability generally support both this pattern and underlying mechanisms. Food chain length has been predicted to have both increasing and unimodal relationships with connectivity as a result of predators being constrained by the patch occupancy of their prey. Although both patterns have been documented empirically, the underlying mechanisms may differ from those predicted by models. In terms of other measures of food web complexity, habitat connectivity has been empirically found to generally increase link density but either reduce or have no effect on connectance, whereas a unimodal relationship is expected. In general, there is growing concordance between empirical patterns and theoretical predictions for some effects of habitat connectivity on food webs, but many predictions remain to be tested over a full connectivity gradient, and empirical metrics of complexity are rarely modeled.

Most large-scale studies focus on birds, large mammals, and threatened species, whereas large-scale population trends of small to medium-sized mammals and species that are currently of least concern remain poorly studied. Large-scale studies are needed because on a smaller scale, important patterns may be masked by local variation and stochastic processes. Here, we utilized snow track census data from Finland and NW Russia to estimate population growth rates of the Eurasian red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris for a period of 17 yr in an area of over 1 000 000 km(2). We also studied the effects of changes in summer and winter temperatures, winter precipitation, predator abundance, and canopy cover on estimated red squirrel population growth rates. Our results suggest that red squirrel populations have declined in most parts of the study area, the only remarkable exception being SW Russia. These results are in concordance with previous studies suggesting that species that are still common and of least concern may be declining.

However, the spatiotemporal synchrony of plague and its driving mechanism have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we transformed the historical European plague database spanned 1347-1800 CE into country-level time-series that differentiated large-scale plague outbreak from counted data. We found that there are 74 years in which two or more countries in our study region (UK, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy) experienced large-scale plague outbreak in the same year. Our Multivariate Ripley's K-function results showed that the onset year and the cessation year of large-scale plague outbreak arc synchronized at the 0-23-year and 0-20-year windows, respectively. The temporal association between such synchrony and climatic forcing was further investigated using the Superposed Epoch Analysis, and drought was found to be responsible for the synchrony. Integrating our results with a literature survey, we suggested that prior to the peak of plague, the occurrence of drought and the subsequent reintroduced rainfall dampened both the rodent community and human society and boosted the number of fleas that carried plague. Such a synthesis facilitated the outbreak of plague. At the same time, high temperature associated with such drought also confined the geographic diffusion of the plague. Hence, although continental mega-drought could initiate the synchrony of plague outbreak, the synchrony actually consisted of a number of localized plague outbreak events scattering across different regions in Europe. According to the projected rising trend of drought in terms of its magnitude, duration, and geographic extent, the risk of synchrony of rodent-borne diseases in Europe will be significantly elevated, especially in France, Italy, and Spain.

Asynchronous fluctuations in the densities of competing consumers can stabilize food web dynamics in constant environments. However, environmental fluctuations often synchronize dynamics in nature. Using the same 'diamond-shape' food web model first used to demonstrate the stabilizing effects of asynchrony in constant environments, we show that weak-to-moderate environmentally induced fluctuations in consumer mortality rates stabilize food webs while disrupting asynchrony. Synchrony actually promotes stability because: (i) synchronous declines in consumer density reduce the maximum abundance of top predators and (ii) resource competition quickly converts synchronous increases in consumer density into synchronous declines. These results are robust to details of food web topology and the implementation of environmental fluctuations. The fluctuation strengths that enhance stability are within the range experienced naturally by many species, suggesting that stabilization via environmental fluctuations is a realistic possibility.",,,,,"Vasseur, David/A-2545-2013","Vasseur, David/0000-0003-1706-9613",,,,,,,,,,,,,1461-023X,,,,,NOV,2007,10,11,,,,,1066,1074,,10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01099.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01099.x,,,,,,,,17727665,,,,,WOS:000249882700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Regions containing multiple populations with similar dynamics were identified using cluster analysis. Two explanations for the observed synchrony were evaluated, dispersal and the Moran effect, a spatially correlated density independent perturbation, such as weather, which occurs across populations. Populations synchronized by dispersal are expected to exhibit a negative relationship between synchrony and distance, while populations synchronized by a Moran effect must have a similar density-dependent structure (DDS). To distinguish bt tu een these hypotheses we used autoregressive modeling to determine the DDS of each population. and cross-correlation to estimate the degree of synchrony between populations. Dispersal alone was assumed to be responsible for synchrony in populations with a significant negative synchrony-distance (S-D) relationship and heterogeneous DDS. We assumed that a Moran effect could have produced synchrony in populations with homogeneous DDS and a non-significant S-D relationship. It was not possible to assign synchrony to a single Factor in regions with a homogeneous DDS and a significant S-D relationship, and we excluded the possibility of a Moran effect in regions with heterogeneous DDS and a non-significant S-D relationship Using these criteria, we identified dispersal as synchronizing populations within one region each of ermine, lynx, mink and red fox and in two regions of muskrat. A Moran effect may have synchronized one region of ermine, fisher, lynx, and mink, although we were unable to identify a causative factor. One lynx and one mink region showed characteristics of both dispersal and Moran-based synchrony and 9 regions of synchrony could not be assigned to either factor. These results show that by examining the DDS and the S-D relationship we were able to determine the factors most likely responsible for synchronized population dynamics in 10 of 21 cases. Possible cases of Moran-based synchrony do not appear to be common, occurring in only 18.2% of these regions. It should also be noted that just as correlation does not imply causation? presence of homogeneous DDS does nor indicate a Moran effect, only its possible occurrence.",,,,,,"Swanson, Bradley/0000-0002-0360-3590",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,AUG,1999,86,2,,,,,265,274,,10.2307/3546444,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3546444,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000082100200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the relative prevalence of the two controls in planktonic ecosystems along the eutrophication and climate gradients has rarely been addressed. Here, using the field surveys of 17 years in a typical bay and estuary, we test two opposite patterns of trophic control dominance and their response to regional temporal eutrophication and climate fluctuations. It was found that trophic control of planktonic ecosystems fluctuated between the dominance of top-down and bottom-up controls on time scales in both the bay and estuary studied. The relative prevalence of these two controls in both ecosystems was significantly driven directly by regional dissolved inorganic nitrogen but, for the estuary, also by the nonlinear effects of regional sea surface temperature. In terms of indirect pathways, community relationships (synchrony and grazing pressure) in the bay are driven by both regional dissolved inorganic nitrogen - soluble reactive phosphorus ratio and sea surface temperature, but this drive did not continue to be transmitted to the trophic control. Conversely, trophic control in estuary was directly related to grazing pressure and indirectly related to synchrony. These findings support the view that eutrophication and climate drive the relative prevalence of top-down versus bottom-up controls at ecosystem and temporal scales in planktonic ecosystems, which has important implications for predicting the potential impacts of anthropogenic and environmental perturbations on the structure and function of marine ecosystems.",,,,,"Wan, Xuhao/JLL-0383-2023; Zhu, Lin/A-7907-2016; Feng, Jianfeng/A-7594-2016","Wan, Xuhao/0000-0003-2612-5867; Feng, Jianfeng/0000-0002-4003-9458",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1354,1879-2448,,,,MAY 15,2024,255,,,,,,,,121487,10.1016/j.watres.2024.121487,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121487,,MAR 2024,,,,,,38518414,,,,,WOS:001216288500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, yearly responses of predators to the host emerging patterns were examined using structural equation modeling. The results revealed that ichneumonid wasps showed a non-delayed synchronous response to erratic fluctuation of the host population, resulting in the maintenance of a constant parasitism ratio. In contrast, soldier beetle population, which tends to moderately fluctuate while maintaining a specific density, showed a low-intensity delayed response without significance in the model. These predator populations without strong delayed density-dependent response are quite unlikely to highly densify causing mass mortality to the host population in the both the current and following years of outbreak.

Outbreak cycles are often assumed to be driven by density-dependent mortality due to natural enemies, because pathogens and predators cause high mortality and because natural-enemy models reproduce fluctuations in defoliation data. The role of induced defenses is in contrast often dismissed, because toxic effects of defenses are often weak and because induced-defense models explain defoliation data no better than natural-enemy models. Natural-enemy models, however, fail to explain gypsy moth outbreaks in North America, in which outbreaks in forests with a higher percentage of oaks have alternated between severe and mild, whereas outbreaks in forests with a lower percentage of oaks have been uniformly moderate. Here we show that this pattern can be explained by an interaction between induced defenses and a natural enemy. We experimentally induced hydrolyzable-tannin defenses in red oak, to show that induction reduces variability in a gypsy moth's risk of baculovirus infection. Because this effect can modulate outbreak severity and because oaks are the only genus of gypsy moth host tree that can be induced, we extended a natural-enemy model to allow for spatial variability in inducibility. Our model shows alternating outbreaks in forests with a high frequency of oaks, and uniform outbreaks in forests with a low frequency of oaks, matching the data. The complexity of this effect suggests that detecting effects of induced defenses on defoliator cycles requires a combination of experiments and models.",,,,,"Dwyer, Greg/L-1134-2015; Haynes, Kyle/C-1374-2012; Elderd, Bret/C-5231-2016","Haynes, Kyle/0000-0002-3283-6633; Elderd, Bret/0000-0001-5853-1136",,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,SEP 10,2013,110,37,,,,,14978,14983,,10.1073/pnas.1300759110,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1300759110,,,,,,,,23966566,,,,,WOS:000324125100044,View Full Record in Web of Science

The distribution of Z. asper has decreased dramatically during the last century. We sampled three sites in suitable habitats in the Beaume River. No impact of individual tagging on survival was found. The demography of the population was analyzed using capture-recapture methods that allow the estimation of survival, recruitment, and demographic growth rates. Annual survival rates were low (0.35-0.50). The level of transience was high (5% to 25%), suggesting that a significant number of individuals were highly mobile or shifted to suboptimal habitats. Seniority rates suggested random highly variable recruitment between years. The three sites had similar variation patterns in all demographic parameters, indicating broad spatial covariation in population dynamics. We found some local differences in demographic parameters, which could be linked to local habitat quality. Individual tagging allowed for the estimation of demographic parameters that improved our understanding of Z. asper population dynamics and revealed mechanisms that may affect population persistence, such as stochastic recruitment, low survival, and frequent dispersal. The fragmentation of habitat through river damming inhibits dispersal and represents a threat to the persistence of Z. asper in the Rhone basin.

Along the southern west coast, trees flower and produce clusters of succulent berries every other year, while in the east, trees mast every 3 years. We investigate two hypotheses for this variation: local adaptation to environmental conditions that favors different reproductive schedules at different locations or variation arising from single stereotyped reproductive strategy in the face of a geographic variation in productivity. To assess the theoretical plausibility of each of these hypotheses, we develop a refined resource budget model for mast reproduction. The refined model assumes that there is a lower bound on the amount of resource that may be allocated to reproduction, which allows the prediction of the relation between reproductive schedules and productivity. From the analysis of the model, we find that the observed geographic transition in rowan mast is caused if either productivity in the east is lower than that in the west or if plants in the eastern populations have evolved to pause reproduction until energy reserves are replenished to higher levels. The prediction by the productivity gradient hypothesis match with the empirical finding that the productivity is, in fact, likely to be lower in the east than the west, although we lack empirical data to test the likelihood of the local adaptation hypothesis.

Detecting and attributing synchrony (i.e. temporally coincident fluctuations in populations' parameters) is key as synchronous populations can become more vulnerable to stochastic events that can affect the viability of harvest and have profound consequences to community structure. Here, we aimed to estimate the level of synchrony in fish growth within and among species across 1 million km(2)and identify the environmental drivers contributing to synchronous population fluctuations. We developed otolith increment-based growth chronologies for two deep-sea scorpaenid fishes (Helicolenus dactylopterusandPontinus kuhlii) from geographically and bathymetrically disjunct populations in the northeast Atlantic (one species in three locations; two species with different depth preferences). We used hierarchical models to partition variation in growth within and between populations attributing it to intrinsic (age, species, population) and extrinsic (environmental variables) drivers. We assessed synchrony in growth variation within and among species and identified common change points in population specific growth patterns. We documented time-variant synchrony in growth variation of geographically and bathymetrically segregated deep-sea fish populations, lasting 25 and 18 years, respectively. The observed synchrony was likely driven by shared environmental forcing (Moran effect) as large-scale climate indices (East Atlantic pattern and North Atlantic Oscillation) were important environmental drivers of overall growth variation while the onset of synchrony in growth variation was likely related to marine regime shifts occurring in a wide area of the northeast Atlantic that affected the entire ecosystem. However, our capacity to extrapolate growth information across species and locations was dependent on the timing and magnitude of environmental change.

We examined inter-annual variation in recruitment among lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) populations in lakes Huron, Michigan and Superior using fishery-dependent and -independent data from 1971 to 2014. Relative year-class strength (RYCS) was calculated from catch-curve residuals for each year class across multiple sampling years. Pairwise comparison of RYCS among datasets revealed no significant associations either within or between lakes, suggesting that recruitment of lake whitefish is spatially asynchronous. There was no consistent correlation between pairwise agreement and the distance between datasets, and models to estimate the spatial scale of recruitment synchrony did not fit well to these data. This suggests that inter-annual recruitment variation of lake whitefish is asynchronous across broad spatial scales in the Great Lakes. While our method primarily evaluated year-to-year recruitment variation, it is plausible that recruitment of lake whitefish varies at coarser temporal scales (e.g. decadal). Nonetheless, our findings differ from research on some other Coregonus species and suggest that local biotic or density-dependent factors may contribute strongly to lake whitefish recruitment rather than inter-annual variability in broad-scale abiotic factors.

In British Columbia, Canada, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is the most prevalent host, and records show that significant outbreaks have primarily occurred in the southern interior over the last century. In the central interior of British Columbia, particularly in the Cariboo Forest Region, the most recent outbreak of western spruce budworm, which is in its second decade, has been severe and widespread. It is perhaps due to this long outbreak, which is unprecedented in duration since detailed surveys began in the 1950s, that there is an anecdotal perception that the western spruce budworm is expanding its range northward into the region, affecting Douglas-fir near the edge of its northern distribution. However, very little is known about the long-term outbreak history of western spruce budworm in the central interior of the province. In this study we used 11 Douglas-fir host chronologies and 2 regional Finns non-host chronologies to reconstruct western spruce budworm outbreaks over a 435-year period. Standard dendrochronological techniques were used to develop tree-ring chronologies at each site and the program OUTBREAK was used to detect outbreak periods. We reconstructed 12 outbreaks starting in early 1600s with a mean return interval of 30 years. Sensitivity analysis illustrated that including light, moderate and severe intensity thresholds modified the number of reconstructed outbreaks, their duration and mean return interval. Sub-regional chronologies based on biogeoclimatic subzones and variants (BEC units), revealed strong synchrony of some outbreak events, but not all. Wavelet analysis of the sub-regional chronologies demonstrated the quasi-periodic behavior of western spruce budworm over the entire record, which averaged 32-years. By reconstructing WSB dynamics over 400 years we demonstrated that outbreaks observed over the last 40 years in the Cariboo Forest Region are not unprecedented.

We compared the effect on population synchrony of two different distance measures, direct (Euclidean) distance and distance via woodland rides and edges, and also of habitat matrix composition. Population synchrony of A. hyperantus was calculated as the pairwise correlation between population time-series using 20 years of data from UK butterfly monitoring scheme transects. Local population synchrony was better explained by distance via woodland edges than direct distance, especially for woodland-dominated transects. These results are consistent with mark-recapture data previously collected on the Ringlet butterfly. The results indicate a sensitivity of population synchrony to butterfly local dispersal behaviour, particularly, to the use of habitat corridors and other functional dispersal routes.

In this study, we show that generalist predators may be important as regulators of leaf beetle populations. All three leaf beetle species, which were studied for five years in 12 plantations, showed a negative correlation between the population growth rate from spring to fall and the abundance of the most common generalist predator Orthotylus marginalis (Heteroptera: Miridae). For the most abundant leaf beetle, Phratora vulgatissima, we also found a significant positive correlation between its population growth rate and egg survival, indicating an overall effect of predation on herbivore population growth. Harvesting, which takes place during the winter, had a negative effect on the abundance of leaf beetles and predators. However, the first year after harvesting, all three leaf beetle species regained this loss with a very high population growth rate. A reason for the better ability of the herbivores to recover from the disturbance may be that they, unlike the predators, mainly overwinter outside the plantations. All three leaf beetles peaked in density three years after harvesting whereas the density of generalist natural enemies increased or leveled off during the five-year period after harvesting. We conclude that predation by generalist predators is potentially important for population control of leaf beetles in willow coppice, but that the intermediate disturbance regime of around five years between harvests, appears to be too short to avoid disruption of biological control. Alternatives for more efficient biological control in short-rotation coppice systems may be a longer period between harvests that enables the predators to fully respond numerically, to leave natural enemies refuges at harvest, or to harvest adjacent plantations asynchronously.",,,,,"Bommarco, Riccardo/E-7109-2016","Bommarco, Riccardo/0000-0001-8888-0476",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,,,,,DEC,2004,14,6,,,,,1624,1633,,10.1890/03-5341,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-5341,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000225858000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The extent of defoliation over time was largely nonstationary and only somewhat periodic; however six major defoliation episodes could be identified. Individual outbreaks tended to span only 36.6% (+/- 13.1% S.E.) of the total area defoliated, suggesting they are frequently terminated before attaining their maximum potential extent. Although outbreaks tended to recur periodically, they were not perfectly synchronized across the province. Two core regions, 14 000 and 20 000 km(2) in size, located in the northwestern, aspen-dominated boreal forest region and the southeastern, maple-dominated mixedwood forest region, were found to exhibit cyclic patterns of defoliation, with periodicities of 9 and 13 years, respectively. These oscillations were characterized by strong second-order negative feedback, suggesting recantation by lagged density-dependent processes. Outbreak cycles in the two core regions were in phase with one another (r = 0.39) until 1963, when a sudden, large-scale outbreak collapse occurred in the North during the initial phase of the third cycle. Since that time outbreak oscillations have been completely out of phase (r = -0.16), leading to a persistent wave-like pattern of outbreak spread back and forth between regions along a northwest-southeast axis. Within core regions, cycle amplitude varied in a slow and smooth manner, with the phasing pattern of amplitude modulation differing substantially between regions. Although the timing of population cycle peaks appears to be highly predictable, at least within the core regions, the levels of defoliation experienced during these peaks appears to be unpredictable and may be modulated by factors yet to be identified.

Using the Monte Carlo technique, we simulated four scenarios: a baseline; a harvest scenario; a SBW scenario; and a scenario including both harvest and SBW. Uncertainty estimation was performed using a bootstrap variance estimator that applies to the context of hybrid inference. The results revealed that the total variances increased over time. For the scenarios including SBW, the variances were three to six times greater than those in the scenarios without outbreaks. Harvesting did not greatly contribute to the total variance.

However, long-distance dispersal is still the least understood aspect of mountain pine beetle ecology. In particular, the mechanisms responsible for the three major phases of long-distance dispersal, the ascent, transport, and descent, are poorly known. In this study, we used the North American Regional Reanalysis meteorological data (1999-2010) to determine climate conditions under and above the forest canopy during mountain pine beetle emergence and flight at the landscape scale. We found that climate conditions are distinct during emergence and flight. They provide an ideal underlying environment to facilitate the potential long-distance dispersal. Climate conditions are unstable under the forest canopy during emergence, which would help loft beetles above the forest canopy to initiate long-distance dispersal.

We analysed the joint spatial and temporal fluctuations in the community structure by fitting the two-dimensional Poisson lognormal model under a two-stage sampling scheme. We partitioned the variance of the distribution of log abundance for a random species at a random time and location into components of demographic stochasticity, ecological heterogeneity among species, and independent environmental noise components for the different species. Non-neutral mechanisms such as ecological heterogeneity among species (20%) and spatiotemporal variation in the environment (75%) explained the majority of the variance in log abundances.

In 2D systems, theory predicts that metapopulation stability should increase with ecosystem size (or habitat network size): Larger ecosystems will harbor more diverse subpopulations with more stable aggregate dynamics. However, current theories developed in simplified landscapes may be inadequate to predict emergent properties of branching ecosystems, an overlooked but widespread habitat geometry. Here, we combine theory and analyses of a unique long-term dataset to show that a scale-invariant characteristic of fractal river networks, branching complexity (measured as branching probability), stabilizes watershed metapopulations. In riverine systems, each branch (i.e., tributary) exhibits distinctive ecological dynamics, and confluences serve as merging points of those branches. Hence, increased levels of branching complexity should confer a greater likelihood of integrating asynchronous dynamics over the landscape. We theoretically revealed that the stabilizing effect of branching complexity is a consequence of purely probabilistic processes in natural conditions, where within-branch synchrony exceeds among-branch synchrony. Contrary to current theories developed in 2D systems, metapopulation size (a variable closely related to ecosystem size) had vague effects on metapopulation stability. These theoretical predictions were supported by 18-y observations of fish populations across 31 watersheds: Our cross-watershed comparisons revealed consistent stabilizing effects of branching complexity on metapopulations of very different riverine fishes.

Historically synchronicity was attributed to external forcing (like weather) that influences local population renewal. It is now understood that forcing can be due to any agent (dispersal, competition, predator-prey interactions) interfering with local processes. Data show that often synchrony levels off with increasing distance among populations. Such a feature suggests presence of population travelling waves. That is, processes of population highs coinciding in time in limited regions while elsewhere in space population lows coincide and the pattern changes in location over time. A poorly studied feature in this context is synchrony across species that is suggested to emerge due to interspecific interaction networks. That external forcing causes populations to fluctuate in step is easy to prove. However, time series of population change do not always necessarily carry any extractable information about the agent that is forcing the population, unless complemented with auxiliary data about the environment and the focal population studied.

This type of information would facilitate timely field studies and enable more rapid counter measures, as well as enable studies of the dynamics of an insect outbreak. In this study we developed a method based on MODIS derived NDVI for near real-time monitoring of insect induced forest defoliation in a subalpine birch forest in northern Sweden. The method is based on deviations from a seasonal trajectory of NDVI representing forest conditions without disturbances. A Kalman filter is applied to handle noise and satellite derived NDVI observations of low quality, and cumulative sums (CUSUM) of the deviations from the seasonal trajectory representing undisturbed forests are used to detect disturbances. An annual offset of the seasonal trajectory is introduced in CUSUM to handle inter-annual variability in the start of season. Evaluation of the method showed that 74% of the defoliation was detected with a misclassification of undisturbed areas of 39% in MODIS pixels with at least 50% birch forest cover. The ability of the method to detect defoliation can be adjusted to fit the purpose of a study; with a higher threshold applied, 100% of the defoliation in the evaluation data was detected with 56% of the undisturbed areas misclassified as defoliated. The method also facilitates studies of the intraseasonal temporal dynamics of an insect outbreak, which is a major advantage compared to methods that classifies pixels into undisturbed or defoliated for an entire season. Furthermore, the method can be extended to monitor within-season refoliation after an insect outbreak. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

At community level, inter-specific synchrony is an important indicator of ecosystem stability and variation in function. Using wavelet analysis on time-series of abundance of 12 dominant diatom species, sampled monthly (1994-2009) in a coastal upwelling embayment at the northern limit of the Canary Current Upwelling System, we find a sudden onset of synchrony between 1998 and 2002, concomitant with an increase in the amplitude of the upwelling index at different temporal scales. To better understand the underlying mechanism that could generate this sudden onset of synchrony among competitors, we analyzed a general model of competition between two species for two essential nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and silicate). We incorporate environmental variation by varying the concentration of one of the essential nutrients entering the system. Increase in the amplitude of environmental variation always leads to greater synchrony among competitors. This occurs because the system shifts from a state in which species are limited by different nutrients to one where species are often limited by the same nutrient. We show that the transition from asynchronous to synchronous dynamics can occur suddenly as the amplitude of environmental variation increases. While it is not possible to rule out alternative mechanisms, our model demonstrates that sudden changes in the extent of synchronization should be a common feature when species compete for essential nutrients in variable environments.",,,,,"Vasseur, David/A-2545-2013; Nogueira García, Enrique/R-6534-2018","Nogueira, Enrique/0000-0002-4222-928X; Buttay, Lucie/0000-0001-9360-7626",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,FEB,2022,67,,,1,SI,,S298,S311,,10.1002/lno.12033,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12033,,FEB 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000752770400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Resource dynamics, pollination success, and, as described here, environmental veto are possible proximate mechanisms driving masting. We explored the environmental veto hypothesis, which assumes that reproductive synchrony is driven by external factors preventing reproduction in some years, by extending the resource budget model of masting with correlated reproductive failure. We ran this model across its parameter space to explore how key parameters interact to drive seeding dynamics. Next, we parameterized the model based on 16yr of seed production data for populations of red (Quercus rubra) and white (Quercusalba) oaks. We used these empirical models to simulate seeding dynamics, and compared simulated time series with patterns observed in the field. Simulations showed that resource dynamics and reproduction failure can produce masting even in the absence of pollen coupling. In concordance with this, in both oaks, among-year variation in resource gain and correlated reproductive failure were necessary and sufficient to reproduce masting, whereas pollen coupling, although present, was not necessary. Reproductive failure caused by environmental veto may drive large-scale synchronization without density-dependent pollen limitation.

However, when considering pests and pathogens, eradication, not persistence, is often the end goal. Humans may intervene to control nuisance populations, resulting in reciprocal interactions between the human and natural systems that can lead to unexpected dynamics. The incidence of these human-natural couplings has been increasing, hastening the need to better understand the emergent properties of such systems in order to predict and manage outbreaks of pests and pathogens. For example, the success of the growing aquaculture industry depends on our ability to manage pathogens and maintain a healthy environment for farmed and wild fish. We developed a model for the dynamics of connected populations subject to control, motivated by sea louse parasites that can disperse among salmon farms. The model includes exponential population growth with a forced decline when populations reach a threshold, representing control interventions. Coupling two populations with equal growth rates resulted in phase locking or synchrony in their dynamics. Populations with different growth rates had different periods of oscillation, leading to quasiperiodic dynamics when coupled. Adding small amounts of stochasticity destabilized quasiperiodic cycles to chaos, while stochasticity was damped for periodic or stable dynamics. Our analysis suggests that strict treatment thresholds, although well intended, can complicate parasite dynamics and hinder control efforts. Synchronizing populations via coordinated management among farms leads to more effective control that is required less frequently. Our model is simple and generally applicable to other systems where dispersal affects the management of pests and pathogens.",,,,,"Lewis, Mark/C-5015-2008","Lewis, Mark/0000-0002-7155-7426",,,,,,,,,,,,,1874-1738,1874-1746,,,,SEP,2016,9,3,,,,,365,380,,10.1007/s12080-016-0295-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-016-0295-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000380357300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

While studies of ecological synchrony are often focused on within-species dynamics, synchrony among species may provide important insights into how dynamics of one species are indicative of conditions relevant to the larger community, with both basic and applied implications. Ecological theory suggests there may be conditions under which communities might exhibit increased synchrony, however, the degree to which these patterns are borne out in natural systems is currently unknown. We used long-term breeding success data from a community of Antarctic seabirds to assess the degree of interspecific, community synchrony, and the role that extreme events play in driving these dynamics. We assessed theoretical links between community synchrony, niche separation, and environmental variability using data from this and three other seabird communities as well as a simulation study. Results show that reproductive success for individual species in the Antarctic seabird community fluctuated relatively independently from one another, resulting in little synchrony across this community, outside of extreme years. While an exceptionally poor year for a given species was not necessarily associated with an exceptionally poor year for any other species, one community-wide extreme year existed. When compared to other seabird communities, this group of Antarctic seabirds exhibited lower overall synchrony and higher estimated niche separation, supporting theoretical predictions. Empirical and simulation-derived results suggest that communities where temporal variation is small for conditions in which species respond substantially differently, and large for conditions in which species respond similarly, may exhibit more synchronous dynamics. Identifying where and why synchronous dynamics might be more apparent has the potential to inform how ecological communities might respond to future global change.",,,,,"Barbraud, Christophe/A-5870-2012; Ji, Rubao/I-1970-2015; Lynch, Heather/E-7371-2012; Li, Yun/F-5944-2015","Li, Yun/0000-0002-4766-4723; Youngflesh, Casey/0000-0001-6343-3311",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,NOV,2021,130,11,,,,,1943,1953,,10.1111/oik.08426,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.08426,,SEP 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000697633700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Qualitative and quantitative data on O. brumata outbreaks were obtained from published sources and previously unpublished material provided by authors of this article. Data cover six decades from the 1950s to the first decade of twenty-first century and most European countries, giving new information fundamental for the understanding of the population ecology of O. brumata. Analyses on epicentral, regional and continental scales show that in each decade, a wave of O. brumata outbreaks travelled across Europe. On average, the waves moved unidirectionally ESEWNW, that is, toward the Scandes and the Atlantic. When one wave reached the Atlantic coast after 910 years, the next one started in East Europe to travel the same c. 3000 km distance. The average wave speed and wavelength was 330 km year-1 and 3135 km, respectively, the high speed being incongruous with sedentary geometrid populations. A mapping of the wave of the 1990s revealed that this wave travelled in a straight EW direction. It therefore passed the Scandes diagonally first in the north on its way westward. Within the frame of the Scandes, this caused the illusion that the wave moved NS. In analogy, outbreaks described previously as moving SN or occurring contemporaneously along the Scandes were probably the result of continental-scale waves meeting the Scandes obliquely from the south or in parallel. In the steppe zone of eastern-most and south-east Europe, outbreaks of the winter moth did not participate in the waves. Here, broadleaved stands are small and widely separated. This makes the zone hostile to short-distance dispersal between O. brumata subpopulations and prevents synchronization within meta-populations. We hypothesize that hostile boundary models, involving reciprocal hostherbivoreenemy reactions at the transition between the steppe and the broadleaved forest zones, offer the best explanation to the origin of outbreak waves. These results have theoretical and practical implications and indicate that multidisciplinary, continentally coordinated studies are essential for an understanding of the spatio-temporal behaviour of cyclic animal populations.",,,,,"Meshkova, Valentyna/GXN-0272-2022; Glavendekic, Milka/AAT-5653-2020; Utkina, Irina/K-5847-2013; Bylund, Helena/F-3857-2017; Gninenko, Yuri/U-8146-2019; Matosevic, Dinka/I-1037-2019; Pajares, Juan Alberto/D-5215-2014; Meshkova, Valentyna/G-3593-2018; Hrasovec, Boris/C-2974-2013; Battisti, Andrea/F-6243-2015","Pajares, Juan Alberto/0000-0002-4682-8984; Matosevic, Dinka/0000-0001-7380-688X; Glavendekic, Milka/0000-0003-1219-8897; Meshkova, Valentyna/0000-0001-6483-2736; Hrasovec, Boris/0000-0003-4172-4593; Battisti, Andrea/0000-0002-2497-3064",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JAN,2013,82,1,,,,,84,95,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.02023.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.02023.x,,,,,,,,22897224,,,,,WOS:000313752300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fluctuations in jack and hooknose abundance were synchronous among populations (i.e., region-wide synchrony), similar to patterns seen previously in Oregon hatchery populations and indicative of oceanic processes operating at large spatial and temporal scales. By contrast, regional-scale synchrony in the ratio of jack to hooknose males was likely attributable to the influences of the freshwater environment. Moreover, within-population variation in phenotype ratio was lower by brood year than by return year (i.e., weak cohort relationship), contrary to previous patterns in hatchery populations. The spatial and temporal patterns of phenotype ratio observed in natural populations but not in hatchery populations, where freshwater effects were statistically controlled, indicate that the frequency dynamics of coho male alternative phenotypes are influenced more strongly by freshwater than by marine processes. The environmentally induced variability in phenotype ratio suggests that there may be constant perturbations of fitness functions for alternative phenotypes, such that the system should be less stable than predicted from the status-dependent selection model with fixed fitness functions.",,,,,"Fleming, Ian/I-7217-2012; Koseki, Yusuke/Q-1176-2019","Koseki, Yusuke/0000-0001-9588-3018; Fleming, Ian/0000-0002-5541-824X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0706-652X,1205-7533,,,,APR,2007,64,4,,,,,743,753,,10.1139/F07-046,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F07-046,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000247602200015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Twelve species showed global synchrony of population counts due to regional population trends and widespread annual population fluctuations. There was a clear link between population fluctuations and winter weather for wren, and three other species showed their largest population declines after the coldest winters. Eight species showed a decline in synchrony with distance between woods, and there was evidence for dispersal causing this pattern in three species. Landscape structure affected patterns of synchrony in several species, with lower synchrony in landscapes with less woodland. For three species, this difference in synchrony across a landscape gradient of decreasing woodland cover accounted for the decline in synchrony over distance. Three species showed greater synchrony between woods with similar amounts of hedgerow in the surrounding landscape, suggesting that the surroundings of a wood influence the population dynamics of some species breeding in the wood. Habitat fragmentation can alter the processes contributing to population synchrony. Loss of woodland reduces the relative abundance of woodland bird species. The remaining patches of habitat are smaller, more isolated and are set in a more hostile landscape, all of which may disrupt dispersal between patches and alter the population dynamics within woods.",,,,,"Hinsley, Shelley/E-6790-2012; Bellamy, Paul/AGI-0321-2022","Bellamy, Paul/0000-0003-2234-2119",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,,,,,JUN,2003,26,3,,,,,338,348,,10.1034/j.1600-0587.2003.03457.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0587.2003.03457.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000183344700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Both large-scale autocorrelated climatic factors (the 'Moran effect') and dispersal between populations are candidates to explain synchrony, although their relative influence is difficult to assess. Only a few investigations have reported patterns of synchrony among freshwater populations, and even fewer directly related these patterns to an environmental variable. In the present study, we analysed the spatio-temporal patterns of fluctuation of 57 brown trout populations widespread across France, each sampled continuously during 5 years. We compared the respective influence of connectivity and stream distance within basins (i.e. that potentially allow a basin-scale dispersal) and environmental factors (hydrological and air temperature variables, available for 37 sites) on the synchrony of brown trout cohort densities (0 +, 1 + and adults). A series of Mantel tests revealed that the degree of synchrony was not related to connectivity or stream distance between sites, suggesting no effect of dispersal at the basin-scale. The degree of synchrony among sites for the 0 + fish was significantly related to the degree of hydrological synchrony (based on high flows during the emergence period). For all three age classes, the synchrony in the temperature patterns did not explain synchrony in trout dynamics.

Various environmental classifications have been developed to group sites according to predefined similarities in abiotic variables (with spatial and/or temporal components) and to explain population dynamics in running waters. These classifications may be useful to managers and decision makers, as studies have shown relationships between time-dependent population variability and environmental classifications on different spatial scales. We investigated whether synchrony among brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations could be explained by three regional (hydro-ecoregions, hydrological units, and natural flow regime classification) and one local environmental classification and their associated variables. We first analysed whether densities of two size classes (0+ and >0+ fish) varied over a large spatial scale (i.e. 112 sites spread throughout France sampled for >11years). We then determined whether the degree of synchrony matched the spatial patterns defined by the environmental classifications. Finally, we investigated whether variables such as river distance between sites, hydrology, and temperature were associated with patterns of synchrony. Overall, relationships observed between synchronies in environmental variables and trout population densities were weak. Synchrony was best explained by the classification based on hydrological units, defined as discrete physical units that provided boundaries with real biological significance for river assemblages (12% for 0+ density and 9% for >0+ density and total densities). However, when considering environmental variables alone, synchrony in trout populations was mainly associated (from 11% to 23%) with seasonal flow variables such as high flows during reproductive and emergence periods. Temperature and river distance did not explain synchrony between trout populations. High flows during emergence appear to be a key driver of brown trout population dynamics. Floods during the reproductive period could explain synchrony among brown trout populations, although the effect was weaker than that of high flows during the emergence period. We concluded that existing physical, morphological, and biogeographical classifications at regional spatial scales were not sufficiently integrative to account for environmental drivers (such as flow variables) that were most associated with the spatiotemporal patterns of synchrony in trout populations. Flow explained synchrony better than classifications did. Further investigations should focus on the spatial patterns of flow variations during the emergence and reproductive periods to derive geographical areas that best capture synchrony patterns in trout dynamics. This approach could be extended to other freshwater fish species for which climatic drivers are important, and may help to explain the distributional changes of exotic species, the propensity of populations to fluctuate synchronously and the scale of synchrony patterns under different scenarios of climate change, or the threat of extinction of native species if the Moran effect is high.",,,,,"bergerot, benjamin/AAD-4591-2021","bergerot, benjamin/0000-0003-4313-4925",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,JUN,2019,64,6,,,,,1226,1238,,10.1111/fwb.13297,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13297,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000477644100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study uses tree rings to reconstruct the history of Ormiscodes outbreaks for the 1850-2005 period and examines relationships between outbreaks and climate variability. We used local climate records to compare outbreak-climate relationships in the northern Patagonian Andes (c. 41 degrees S) and the cooler southern Patagonian Andes (c. 49 degrees S). We also examined relationships between outbreak events and regional climate variability driven by variability in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Although relationships between Ormiscodes outbreaks and climate proved to be complex, in northern Patagonia defoliation events are associated with drier and warmer than average growing seasons. Warming and drying trends in Patagonia during the latter part of the 20th century have been linked to a positive trend in SAM. During the post-1976 period of accelerated warming in Patagonia, widespread defoliation outbreaks have occurred in both northern and southern Patagonia but the increase in frequency of events has been greater in the south. In southern Patagonia the increases in frequency of outbreaks in the late 20th century appear to be unprecedented over the c. 150 year tree-ring record of reconstructed outbreaks. These results are consistent with the greater magnitude of recent warming in southern Patagonia, and suggest that under predicted warmer and drier climates in the 21st century, defoliator outbreaks may continue to increase in frequency.

However, their relative impact has usually been considered independently. Here we address the question of how caterpillar habitat quality and parasitism prevalence interact to shape habitat selection in the bog fritillary butterfly Boloria eunomia, parasitized at the caterpillar stage by a specialist wasp, Cotesia eunomiae. We first classified habitat quality by relating caterpillar density to descriptors of different microhabitat types. Second, we investigated parasitism prevalence in those different microhabitats. Our results show that caterpillars and parasitoids mapped onto the same microhabitats, mainly zones with high abundance of the host plant. Accordingly, we suggest that both egg-laying females and parasitoids use the same cues for habitat selection. As a consequence, there should be a fitness cost for B. eunomia females to lay their eggs in places where parasitism prevalence is high. We indeed detected that B. eunomia females frequently laid eggs in habitat types that presented suboptimal microhabitat conditions for caterpillars. This suggests that the lower parasitism prevalence in these suboptimal habitat types counterbalances lower caterpillar survival, leading to an overall similar survival in optimal and suboptimal habitat types. Spreading eggs in different habitat types is thus expected to be a safe strategy to mitigate the adverse possible effects of environmental stochasticity and parasitism prevalence on offspring survival unequal among microhabitat types. From a conservation viewpoint, the preservation of habitat heterogeneity, including optimal but also suboptimal habitat areas, is crucial to ensure persistence of both the host and its parasitoid.",,,,,"Baguette, Michel/HHZ-3609-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,,,DEC,2011,20,13,,,SI,,3117,3131,,10.1007/s10531-011-0151-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-011-0151-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000297170900016,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a constant environment, compensatory dynamics between species can maintain food web stability, but factors that synchronize population fluctuations within and between communities are expected to be destabilizing. We studied the dynamics of a food web in a metacommunity to determine how environmental variability and dispersal affect stability by altering compensatory dynamics and average species abundance. When dispersal rate is high, weak correlated environmental fluctuations promote food web stability by reducing the amplitude of compensatory dynamics. However, when dispersal rate is low, weak environmental fluctuations reduce food web stability by inducing intraspecific synchrony across communities. Irrespective of dispersal rate, strong environmental fluctuations disrupt compensatory dynamics and decrease stability by inducing intermittent correlated fluctuations between consumers in local food webs, which reduce both total consumer abundance and predator abundance. Strong correlated environmental fluctuations lead to (i) spatially asynchronous and highly correlated local consumer dynamics when dispersal is low and (ii) spatially synchronous but intermediate local consumer correlation when dispersal is high. By controlling intraspecific synchrony, dispersal mediates the capacity of strong environmental fluctuations to disrupt compensatory dynamics at both local and metacommunity scales.",,,,,"Gouhier, Tarik/C-3611-2009; Gonzalez, Andrew/F-2247-2010","Gouhier, Tarik/0000-0002-9537-7358; Gonzalez, Andrew/0000-0001-6075-8081",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,FEB,2010,175,2,,,,,E16,E34,,10.1086/649579,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/649579,,,,,,,,20059366,,,,,WOS:000273650200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Synchrony therefore tends to destabilize meta-populations and meta-communities. Quantifying interspecific synchrony in demographic parameters, like abundance, survival, or reproduction, is thus a way to indirectly assess the stability of meta-populations and meta-communities. Moreover, it is particularly informative to identify environmental drivers of interspecific synchrony because those drivers are important across species. Using a Bayesian hierarchical multisite multispecies mark-recapture model, we investigated temporal interspecific synchrony in annual adult apparent survival for 16 common songbird species across France for the period 2001-2016. Annual adult survival was largely synchronous among species (73%, 95% credible interval [47%-94%] of the variation among years was common to all species), despite species differing in ecological niche and life history. This result was robust to different model formulations, uneven species sample sizes, and removing the long-term trend in survival. Synchrony was also shared across migratory strategies, which suggests that environmental forcing during the 4-month temperate breeding season has a large-scale, interspecific impact on songbird survival. However, the strong interspecific synchrony was not easily explained by a set of candidate weather variables we defined a priori. Spring weather variables explained only 1.4% [0.01%-5.5%] of synchrony, while the contribution of large-scale winter weather indices may have been stronger but uncertain, accounting for 12% [0.3%-37%] of synchrony.

We compared annual autumn body mass variation in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) from Poland over the period 1982-2002, and related this to variation in winter and summer climate and plant phenological development [the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from satellites]. Roe deer fawns (similar to 1.3 kg increase from year 1982 to 2002) and yearlings both increased markedly in mass over years. There was also an increase for wild boar mass over years (similar to 4.2 kg increase for piglets from 1982 to 2002). Despite our failure to link annual body mass to spring or winter conditions or the NDVI, the body mass of roe deer and wild boar fluctuated in synchrony. As this was a field roe deer population, and since wild boar is an omnivore, we suggest this may be linked to annual variation and trends in crop structure (mainly rye).

We first characterized populations according to long-term trends, strength of population regulation, and cycle presence and length. We then asked whether these attributes could be predicted by geography, taxonomy, and life-history traits. Roughly half of time series exhibited a long-term trend, and agricultural pests were more likely to be declining, while forest pests were more likely to be increasing. Approximately one quarter of records exhibited periodic oscillations, and we used their statistical properties to infer whether the oscillations were environmentally forced or arose from density dependence. Insects hatching in early spring may be more strongly influenced by environmental forcing, for example, early springs or late spring frosts, than species hatching later. Our findings suggest roles of climate change, forest compositional change, and agricultural practices in driving long-term change in pest populations.",,,,,"Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008; Tooker, John/P-6421-2014; Johnson, Derek/B-6409-2012","Walter, Jonathan/0000-0003-2983-751X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,MAY,2018,9,5,,,,,,,e02274,10.1002/ecs2.2274,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2274,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000435640100031,View Full Record in Web of Science

Limited research describes the climate conditions associated with WSB outbreaks and historical fire activity in these forests, and the spatial stability of these relationships across landscapes. Site-specific and regional characterizations of these relationships are required to establish the historical baselines necessary to document disturbance-climate relationships within dry conifer forests. We compiled site-level and regionalized tree-ring chronologies of fire (AD 1600-2013) and WSB (AD 1600-2009) outbreaks for both lower montane forests adjacent to expansive grasslands and middle montane forests (regionalized grassland and non-grassland chronologies). At site and regional scales, the relation between fire years, outbreaks of WSB, reconstructed values of the Palmer Drought Severity Index, and annual precipitation were examined using superposed epoch and bivariate event analyses. Regional disturbance-climate relationships were used to evaluate the influence of grassland proximity on these relationships and the disturbance history characteristics. The findings show that fires affecting grassland proximal sites in lower montane forests were historically more frequent than fires occurring in middle montane forests and were related to warm, dry conditions in the fire year and cool, wet conditions in the year(s) preceding the fire. These results indicate the climate conditions associated with both fine fuel growth and drying are key determinants for fire activity in lower montane forests. The initiation of WSB outbreaks was significantly related to drought, and this relationship was enhanced at lower montane sites. We also examined the interrelationships between fire years and WSB outbreaks, but no associations were discerned. Considering the recent escalation of widespread forest fire activity in the Pacific Northwest of North America and the potential for timber losses associated with WSB defoliation, the findings provide information important to forest scientists charged with promoting forest health and resilience in the dry montane forests of interior British Columbia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,MAR,2018,9,3,,,,,,,e02126,10.1002/ecs2.2126,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2126,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000521980900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although primary production and respiration are fundamental to energy cycling in aquatic ecosystems, we know relatively little about how habitat scale influences metabolism. In this study, we adopted a multi-scale habitat approach to evaluate primary production and respiration in a coastal Great Lakes watershed that is experiencing pressure from past, present, and anticipated future human activities. We divided the watershed into five macrohabitats (stream, river, wetland, drowned-river mouth lake, and Great Lake), two mesohabitats (benthic and water column), and four microhabitats (periphytic substrates: sand/sediment, rock, wood, and plant) for evaluation of spatial patterns and synchrony in metabolism. Factors that influenced patterns of metabolism were scale dependent. Algal biomass strongly influenced spatial patterns in metabolism at the meso- and microhabitat scales; greater algal biomass translated to higher areal-specific and lower chlorophyll-specific metabolism at benthic mesohabitat and sand/sediment and rock microhabitats. Benthic metabolism overwhelmed water column metabolism, irrespective of location or time of year. Watershed position was important at the macrohabitat scale, with greater overall metabolism in macrohabitats located lower in the watershed. Average synchrony in metabolism rates was greatest at the macrohabitat scale, suggesting metabolic patterns that are evident at finer scales may become integrated at coarser scales. Our results (1) show that spatial and temporal patterns in metabolism are shaped by factors that are dependent upon habitat scale; (2) highlight the importance of benthic productivity across habitat and season; and (3) suggest that hydrologic connectivity strongly influences ecosystem processes, although physical factors can affect these responses as evidenced by the low levels of synchrony between Lake Michigan and the other macrohabitats.",,,,,"Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014","Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305",,,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,MAR,2010,13,2,,,,,222,238,,10.1007/s10021-009-9312-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-009-9312-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000275785700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A central question in population ecology is how to estimate the effects of common environmental noise, e.g. due to large-scale climate patterns, on the synchrony in population fluctuations over large distances. We show how the environmental variance can be split into components generated by several environmental variables and how these can be estimated from time-series observations. 2. With a set of time-series observations from different locations not necessarily covering the same time span, it is shown how the spatial autocorrelation of the residual variance component, not explained by the covariates and corrected for demographic stochasticity, can be estimated using classical multinormal theory. 3. Some previous results on spatial scaling in continuous linearized models on log scale are extended to also provide the scaling for the residuals. This is shown to be close to the spatial scaling of the autocorrelation in the environmental noise and only weakly affected by migration. 4.

V.",,,Metacommunity stability and persistence for predation turnoff in selective patches,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Predation as an important trophic interaction of ecological communities controls the large-scale patterns of species distribution, population abundance and community structure. Numerous studies address that predation can mediate diversity and regulate the ecological community and food web stability through changes in the behavior, morphology, development, and abundance of prey. Since predation has large effects on persistence and diversity, the local loss or removal of predation in a community can trigger a cascade of extinctions. In ecological theory, the effect of predation removal has been well studied in foodwebs, but it remains unclear in the case of a spatially distributed community connected by dispersal. In this study, the interaction between local and spatial processes is taken into account, we present how a predation turnoff in selective patches affects the synchronized oscillatory dynamics of a metacommunity. Using a simple predator-prey metacommunity with a diffusive dispersal, we show the impact of predation on synchronized, asynchronized and source-sink dynamics. Our results reveal that predation turnoff in very few patches stabilizes the metacommunity by damping the perfectly synchronized oscillatory state into multicluster equilibrium (i.e., steady) states. In a source-sink behavior, predation turnoff in a source patch reduces the number of sink patches and changes the clusters. In general, predation turnoff in low number of patches shows non-zero equilibrium states in both prey and predator populations, whereas predation turnoff in a larger number of patches can lead to the complete extinction of predators. Moreover, prey density from the patches where predation is absent goes to a saturating state near the carrying capacity. Thus, this study stresses that predation turnoff in selective patches acts as a stabilizing mechanism to promote the metacommunity persistence.",,,,,"D.

To achieve these benefits, coexisting species subjected to the same predator would benefit from a similar pattern of seeding fluctuation over time that could lead to a reduction in predation at the within-species level. We tested for the existence of an environmental factor enforcing synchrony in acorn production in two sympatric Mediterranean oaks ( Quercus ilex and Q. humilis) and the consequences on within-species and between species acorn predation, by monitoring 15 mixed forests (450 trees) over seven years. Acorn production in Q. ilex and Q. humilis was highly variable among years, with high population variability (CVp) values. The two species exhibited a very different pattern across years in their initial acorn crop size ( sum of aborted, depredated, and sound acorns). Nevertheless, interannual differences in summer water stress modified the likelihood of abortion during acorn ripening and enforced within-and, particularly, between-species synchrony and population variability in acorn production. The increase in CVp from initial to mature acorn crop ( after summer) accounted for 33% in Q. ilex, 59% in Q. humilis, and 60% in the two species together. Mean yearly acorn pre-dispersal predation by invertebrates was considerably higher in Q. humilis than in Q. ilex. Satiation and starvation of predators was recorded for the two oaks, and this effect was increased by the year-to-year variability in the size of the acorn crop of the two species combined. Moreover, at a longer time scale ( over seven years), we observed a significant reduction in the mean proportion of acorns depredated for each oak and the variability in both species' acorn production combined. Therefore, our results demonstrate that similar patterns of seeding fluctuation over time in coexisting species mediated by an environmental cue ( summer drought) may contribute to the reduction of the impact of seed predation at a within-species level. Future research should be aimed at addressing whether this process could be a factor assisting in the coexistence of Q. ilex and Q. humilis.",,,,,"Retana, Javier/L-1214-2014; Espelta, Josep Maria/I-3891-2016; Molowny-Horas, Roberto/D-1171-2014","Retana, Javier/0000-0002-7505-9467; Espelta, Josep Maria/0000-0002-0242-4988; Molowny-Horas, Roberto/0000-0003-2626-6379",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,MAR,2008,89,3,,,,,805,817,,10.1890/07-0217.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-0217.1,,,,,,,,18459343,,,,,WOS:000254678200021,View Full Record in Web of Science

We present a mussel metapopulation model to elucidate the role of landscape-level disturbance cycles for regional response of mussel populations to onshore productivity and larval transport. Landscape dynamics are generated through spatially explicit rules, and each landscape is connected to its neighbor through unidirectional larval dispersal. The role of landscape disturbance cycles in the regional system behavior is elucidated ( 1) in demographically open vs. demographically coupled systems, in relation to ( 2) onshore reproductive output and ( 3) the temporal scale of landscape disturbance dynamics. By controlling for spatial structure at the landscape and metapopulation levels, we first demonstrate the interaction between landscape and oceanographic connectivity. The temporal scale of disturbance cycles, as controlled by mussel colonization rate, plays a critical role in the regional behavior of the system. Indeed, fast disturbance cycles are responsible for regional synchrony in relation to onshore reproductive output. Slow disturbance cycles, however, lead to increased robustness to changes in productivity and to demographic coupling. These testable predictions indicate that the occurrence and temporal scale of local disturbance recovery dynamics can drive large-scale variability in demographically open systems, and the response of metapopulations to changes in nearshore productivity.",,,,,"Gouhier, Tarik/C-3611-2009","Gouhier, Tarik/0000-0002-9537-7358",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,MAR,2007,88,3,,,,,647,657,,10.1890/06-0672,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-0672,,,,,,,,17503593,,,,,WOS:000245668500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Another geometrid, the winter moth Operophtera brumata, did not increase in density until the autumnal moth had its post-peak in 2004, and was at its own peak concurrent with the steeply declining autumnal moth abundance in 2005-06. The body size variables measured (forewing lengths of males and females and hind femur lengths of males) of the autumnal moth showed a similar density-dependent response, i.e. increasing density was associated with decreasing body size and fecundity. Nevertheless, regression analyses clearly ranked the pooled geometrid abundance without a time lag as the best predictor for the body size variation, ahead of the abundance of the autumnal moth or past abundance of all geometrids. Nondelayed effects of lowered food quality and absolute shortage of foliage under congested conditions are the most plausible reasons for reduced body size. Two most commonly proposed causal factors of the autumnal moth population cycle, i.e. delayed inducible resistance of the host plant (mountain birch Betula pubescens czerepanovii) and delayed density-dependent parasitism by specialized hymenopteran parasitoids, cannot easily explain the diverging population trends between the autumnal and winter moths. We suggest that either the inducible resistance of the host tree or the host utilization of the most important parasitoids and/or pathogens have to be strictly species-specific between these closely related moth species to produce the population dynamics observed.

We, therefore, examined how variation in annual weather patterns associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) over four decades was linked to synchrony and stability in a metacommunity of stream invertebrates across multiple, contrasting headwaters in central Wales (UK). Prolonged warmer and wetter conditions during positive NAO winters appeared to synchronize variations in population and community composition among and within streams thereby reducing stability across levels of ecological organization. This climatically mediated synchronization occurred in all streams irrespective of acid-base status and land use, but was weaker where invertebrate communities were more functionally diverse. Wavelet linear models indicated that variation in the NAO explained up to 50% of overall synchrony in species abundances at a timescale of 4-6 years. The NAO appeared to affect ecological dynamics through local variations in temperature, precipitation and discharge, but increasing hydrochemical variability within sites during wetter winters might have contributed. Our findings illustrate how large-scale climatic fluctuations generated over the North Atlantic can affect population persistence and dynamics in inland freshwater ecosystems in ways that transcend local catchment character. Protecting and restoring functional diversity in stream communities might increase their stability against warmer, wetter conditions that are analogues of ongoing climate change.

We developed and parameterized a mechanistic model describing mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) population demographics and dispersal across a landscape. Model components include temperature-dependent phenology, host tree colonization determined by an Allee effect, and random-walk dispersal with motility conditioned by host tree density. The model was parameterized at a study site in central Idaho, United States (US), and evaluated at an independent site in northern Washington, US. Phloem and air temperatures, MPB spatial impact data from USDA Forest Service aerial detection surveys, and remotely sensed host tree density data were used to parameterize the model using a maximum likelihood approach. At both study sites the model was highly accurate (>84%) in predicting annual pattern formation when the model was re-initiated each year with the location of new patches of infested trees. Prediction of annual population growth at both sites was also good (>90%), although the model under-predicted area impacted at the Washington site, and at both sites was unable to predict initiation of new small patches. Our model extends previous research by providing a mechanistic description of the link between motility, dispersal and temperature-dependent MPB phenology. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Flower, A",,,,"Flower, Aquila",,,Three Centuries of Synchronous Forest Defoliator Outbreaks in Western North America,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Insect outbreaks often occur synchronously across large spatial scales, but the long-term temporal stability of the phenomenon and the mechanisms behind it are not well understood. In this study, I use a widespread lepidopteran defoliator native to western North America-the western spruce budworm-as a case study to explore patterns of and potential causes for synchronous population fluctuations. Analyses of synchrony are typically severely limited by the short historical records available for many species. To overcome this limitation, I compiled multi-century dendrochronological reconstructions of western spruce budworm outbreaks from across much of the species' range. This allowed me to analyze synchrony at a sub-continental spatial scale over the last three centuries. I found statistically significant synchrony among regional outbreak records up to 2,000 km apart and identified numerous outbreak periods that occurred synchronously across much of the species' range. I quantified spatial and temporal associations between climate and synchronous outbreak periods using paleoclimate reconstructions. The spatial patterns of outbreak histories and climate records were remarkably similar, with higher similarity in outbreak histories apparent between regions with more similar climate conditions. Synchronous outbreaks typically occurred during periods of average or above average moisture availability preceded by periods of low moisture availability. My results suggest that climatic variability has played a key role in synchronizing western spruce budworm population fluctuations in disjunct forests across western North America for at least the last three centuries. Widespread synchrony appears to be a natural part of this species' population dynamics, though synchronous outbreaks have occurred more frequently during the 20th century than during prior centuries. This study uses a novel combination of statistical methods and dendrochronological data to provide analyses of this species' population dynamics with an unprecedented combination of spatial extent and temporal depth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,OCT 13,2016,11,10,,,,,,,e0164737,10.1371/journal.pone.0164737,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164737,,,,,,,,27737003,,,,,WOS:000385505800124,View Full Record in Web of Science

The identity and effect of these factors may vary among coexisting species that differ in leaf habit, potentially resulting in temporally asynchronous patterns of seed production. In this study, we aim to identify the proximate causes of mast-seeding using two oak species with contrasting leaf habit that coexist in southern Spain, the deciduous Quercus canariensis and the evergreen Q.suber. Simultaneously, we review the literature on environmental drivers of mast-seeding in Mediterranean oaks, distinguishing between evergreen and deciduous species. Our results indicate that Mediterranean oaks are primarily sensitive to weather, mast-seeding being strongly correlated with water availability and air temperature, mainly in the spring and summer. The two study oak species were affected by weather in quite different ways, most likely because of different abiotic requirements as well as contrasting functional strategies of resource use and biomass allocation. Specifically, annual seed production in Q.canariensis was more severely limited by drought than in Q.suber, but responded positively to warmer spring temperatures.Q.canariensis showed a large interannual variability, whereas Q.suber exhibited much more constant seed production. These two species also exhibited a very low level of synchrony in their temporal patterns of seed crop size, most likely due to phenological differences in the processes of flowering and seed maturation.Synthesis. Our results indicate that weather plays a crucial role as a proximate driver of mast-seeding in Mediterranean oaks. We hypothesize that the current abundance of co-occurring species that differ in leaf habit could be altered under future climate change scenarios. The decline of seed production with drier conditions will be potentially greater in deciduous species, particularly those inhabiting wetter sites. Alternatively, the expected warmer temperatures could negatively affect evergreen species as a consequence of their more conservative strategy of biomass allocation. Our findings suggest that understanding how species with different functional or phenological attributes adjust their reproductive abilities to weather may enable us to infer the effects of ongoing environmental changes on population recruitment and dynamics.",,,,,"Koenig, Walter/A-5509-2009; PADILLA-DIAZ, CARMEN MARIA/C-6762-2019; Perez-Ramos, Ignacio/H-6048-2015; Maranon, Teodoro/K-6648-2014","PADILLA-DIAZ, CARMEN MARIA/0000-0002-7220-8041; Perez-Ramos, Ignacio/0000-0003-2332-7818; Maranon, Teodoro/0000-0002-7751-9316",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,MAY,2015,103,3,,,,,691,700,,10.1111/1365-2745.12400,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12400,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000353640500016,View Full Record in Web of Science

If population fluctuations are partly synchronized or concordant, this will produce interannual variability in the community's aggregate abundance and generate temporal variance in ecosystem structure. We studied the community of Lepidoptera inhabiting northern hardwood forests in New Hampshire, USA, to evaluate the hypothesis that fluctuations in consumer communities can arise from concordant dynamics of constituent populations. Interannual comparisons of moth abundances for >75 species sampled at three sites over four years revealed that concordant dynamics contribute strongly to interannual variability in the abundance of consumers. A conspicuous decline in community abundance from 2004 to 2005 was the result of predominantly negative population growth rates of the component species, while an increase in community abundance from 2006 to 2007 was the result of predominantly positive population growth rates. Population dynamics most strongly linked species that feed in the early season (perhaps due to shared responses to climatic effects), but not species that might share natural enemies or host plants. The observed concordant dynamics introduced conspicuous temporal variation in the abundance of primary consumers relative to plants and secondary consumers, thereby altering the forest's trophic structure. Such variance in the aggregate abundance of forest primary consumers could generate time-lagged fluctuations in abundances of secondary consumers and will generally have important consequences for ecosystem properties and processes that are nonlinear functions of consumer abundance, such as plant community structure and nutrient cycling.",,,,,"Ayres, Matthew/AAI-6873-2020","Ayres, Matthew/0000-0001-6120-9068",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,OCT,2011,34,5,,,,,772,779,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06940.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06940.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000296972200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Global climate change likely alters the structure and function of vegetation and the stability of terrestrial ecosystems. It is therefore important to assess the factors controlling ecosystem resilience from local to global scales. Here we assess terrestrial vegetation resilience over the past 35 years using early warning indicators calculated from normalized difference vegetation index data. On a local scale we find that climate change reduced the resilience of ecosystems in 64.5% of the global terrestrial vegetated area. Temperature had a greater influence on vegetation resilience than precipitation, while climate mean state had a greater influence than climate variability. However, there is no evidence for decreased ecological resilience on larger scales. Instead, climate warming increased spatial asynchrony of vegetation which buffered the global-scale impacts on resilience.

We analyzed long-term (30-47 years) individual-based data on two bighorn sheep populations and one mountain goat population in Alberta, Canada. The effect of cougar predation episodes and pneumonia epizootics on annual population growth rate was twice as strong as that of population density. While pneumonia reduced adult female and juvenile survival and predation episodes decreased all demographic rates, high density lowered only juvenile survival. Long-term studies are pivotal for understanding the dynamics of large herbivore populations, but they are rarely duplicated. Our analysis of three mountain ungulate populations with similar life history and ecological characteristics provides evidence that infrequent sporadic events can have a greater relative influence on annual population growth than density-dependent factors in isolated populations. This result contrasts with studies of larger, well-connected populations, highlighting the importance of considering sporadic events in the management and conservation of isolated populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,DEC 1,2024,204,6,,,,,574,588,,10.1086/732876,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/732876,,DEC 2024,,,,,,39556877,,,,,WOS:001330749100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current process-based modeling approaches of insect outbreaks are often based on population processes operating at small spatial scales (i.e. within individual forest stands). As such, they are difficult to parameterize and offer limited applicability when modeling and predicting outbreaks at the landscape level where management actions take place. In this paper, we propose a new process-based landscape model of forest insect outbreaks that is based on stand defoliation, the Forest-Infected-Recovering-Forest (FIRF) model. We explore both spatially-implicit (mean field equations with global dispersal) and spatially-explicit (cellular automata with limited dispersal between neighboring stands) versions of this model to assess the role of dispersal in the landscape dynamics of outbreaks. We show that density-dependent dispersal is necessary to generate cyclic outbreaks in the spatially-implicit version of the model. The spatially-explicit FIRF model with local and stochastic dispersal displays cyclic outbreaks at the landscape scale and patchy outbreaks in space, even without density-dependence. Our simple, process-based FIRF model reproduces large scale outbreaks and can provide an innovative approach to model and manage forest pests at the landscape scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We tested this prediction for two threatened species of Procellariiformes sharing similar life history traits: the European Storm Petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) and the Balearic Shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus). Within each species, we compared adult Survival, proportion of transients (breeders that do not settle), and average productivity at two neighboring colonies. Physical and environmental features (e.g., food availability) of the breeding sites were similar. However, while Balearic Shearwater colonies were free of predators, aerial predators occurred especially in one colony of the European Storm Petrel. Despite this difference, we found similar results for the two species. A high proportion of transient birds was detected in only one colony of each species, ranging between 0.00-0.38 and 0.10-0.63 for the petrels and shearwaters, respectively. This seems to be all emergent feature of spatially structured populations of seabirds, unrelated to colony size or predator pressure, that can have important demographic consequences for local population dynamics and their synchrony. Local survival of resident birds was different Lit each colony, an unexpected result, especially for predator-free colonies of Balearic Shearwater. Productivity varied between the two colonies of European Storm Petrels, but not between the two colonies of Balearic Shearwaters. We demonstrated that within each species, several demographic parameters were colony specific and Sufficiently different to generate short-term asynchronous dynamics.

In 27 instances, both teams surveyed the same site in the same year between 30 June and 18 July. For the 18 most frequently recorded species, abundance indices (individuals/h per site) significantly covaried between teams for 11 (61%) species, including 2/3 prairie specialists tested. No species significantly correlated negatively, 17/18 species had positive correlations, and the preponderance of positive correlations was significant. Swengel indices per hour (two surveyors; unlimited-width transect) averaged 2.42 times Schlicht indices (one surveyor; fixed-width transect). These results demonstrate that transect surveys by different teams at the same sites but not the same routes produce similar rankings of species abundance among sites. This approach to population monitoring (transect surveys during the season that covers the most specialist species at once, not necessarily with fixed routes but recording all species seen) might also be appropriate in other regions with high habitat loss and low human population density. Abundance indices from surveys by seven teams spanning 1979-2005 were calculated for evaluating population trends. For the five analyzable specialist species, 25/30 population trend tests of a species at a site had a negative direction, a highly significant skewing (P < 0.0001). By contrast, five common (most frequently recorded non-specialist) species had an even distribution of negative and positive trends.

The development rates of both plants and insects are highly sensitive to temperature. Although considerable work has examined the effects of temperature on spring phenologies of plants and insects individually, few studies have examined how anticipated warming will influence their phenological synchrony. We applied elevated temperatures of 1.7 and 3.4 degrees C in a controlled chamberless outdoor experiment in northeastern Minnesota, USA to examine the relative responses in onset of egg eclosion by forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hubner) and budbreak of two of its major host trees (trembling aspen, Populus tremuloides Michaux, and paper birch, Betula papyrifera Marshall). We superimposed four insect population sources and two overwintering regimes onto these treatments, and computed degree-day models. Timing of egg hatch varied among population source, overwintering location, and spring temperature regime. As expected, the development rates of plants and insects advanced under warmer conditions relative to ambient controls. However, budbreak advanced more than egg hatch. The degree of phenological synchrony between M. disstria and each host plant was differentially altered in response to warming. The interval by which birch budbreak preceded egg hatch nearly doubled from ambient to +1.7 degrees C. In the case of aspen, the sequence changed from egg hatch preceding, to following, budbreak at +3.4 degrees C. Additionally, under temperature regimes simulating future conditions, some insect populations currently south of our study sites became more synchronous with the manipulated hosts than did currently coexisting insect populations. These findings reveal how climate warming can alter insect-host plant interactions, through changes in phenological synchrony, possibly driving host shifts among tree species and genotypes. They also suggest how herbivore variability, both among populations and within individual egg masses, may provide opportunities for adaptation, especially in species that are highly mobile and polyphagous.

Previous studies have tested for synchrony in different populations of single species, and those including data from more than one species have compared fluctuations in only one demographic parameter. We tested for synchrony in inter-annual changes in breeding population abundance and productivity among four tern species on Coquet Island, northeast England. We also examined how manipulation of one independent environmental variable (predator abundance) influenced temporal changes in ecologically similar and dissimilar tern species. Changes in breeding abundance and productivity of ecologically similar species (Arctic Sterna paradisaea, Common S. hirundo and Roseate Terns S. dougallii) were synchronous with one another over time, but not with a species with different foraging and breeding behaviour (Sandwich Terns Thalasseus sandvicensis). With respect to changes in predator abundance, there was no clear pattern. Roseate Tern abundance was negatively correlated with that of large gulls breeding on the island from 1975 to 2013, while Common Tern abundance was positively correlated with number of large gulls, and no significant correlations were found between large gull and Arctic and Sandwich Tern populations. Large gull abundance was negatively correlated with productivity of Arctic and Common Terns two years later, possibly due to predation risk after fledging, while no correlation with Roseate Tern productivity was found. The varying effect of predator abundance is most likely due to specific differences in the behaviour and ecology of even these closely-related species. Examining synchrony in multi-species assemblages improves our understanding of how whole communities react to long-term changes in the environment and suggests that changes in predator abundance may differentially affect populations of sympatric seabird species.",,,,,"Monaghan, Pat/E-6810-2015","Monaghan, Pat/0000-0003-2430-0326; Bolton, Mark/0000-0001-5605-687X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JUN 26,2015,10,6,,,,,,,e0131543,10.1371/journal.pone.0131543,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131543,,,,,,,,26115174,,,,,WOS:000358147500170,View Full Record in Web of Science

Synchronous western spruce budworm outbreaks can occur over much of a host species' range, causing widespread limb and tree mortality, regeneration delays, and reduction in tree growth rates. Observational outbreak records in northern Washington State extend back only to the mid-20th century, limiting our understanding of this species' long-term population dynamics. In this study, we used dendrochronological methods to reconstruct multicentury outbreak records at four sites in the Okanogan Highlands of northeastern Washington State. We assessed long-term changes in outbreak patterns and tested moisture availability as a potential driving factor of western spruce budworm population dynamics. Outbreak synchrony was found to increase after the late 19th century, especially for high-intensity outbreaks, possibly due to anthropogenic factors. Moisture availability records show that outbreaks tend to occur at the end of droughts. As the variability of climate conditions is projected to increase, trending towards warm and dry summer conditions, the intensity and frequency of high-intensity western spruce budworm outbreaks may increase as well.",,,,,"Ellis, Todd/GZB-1761-2022","Ellis, Todd/0000-0002-4410-8676",,,,,,,,,,,,,0045-5067,1208-6037,,,,SEP,2017,47,9,,,,,1266,1277,,10.1139/cjfr-2016-0399,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2016-0399,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000408223000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

These outbreaks are separated by periods of low insect density and little defoliation. In many cases, the underlying cause of these outbreaks is unknown. 2. Mechanistic models are an important tool for understanding population outbreaks, but existing consumer-resource models predict that severe defoliation should happen much more often than is seen in nature. 3.

These changes in flow regimes can strongly affect riverine fish populations; therefore, assessing the recovery of populations following these episodic events provides important information to help guide species management. This study investigated the dynamics of 5 spatially distinct riverine populations of the nationally endangered Macquarie perch Macquaria australasica in southeastern Australia from 2007-2018, a period that included the tail end of a decadal long drought followed by extreme fluctuations in river flow. Modelling catch rates and size trends, we found that 4 of the 5 populations showed some synchrony and underwent a slow recovery that was undetectable for several years. The largest increases in population size were driven by the survival of new recruits. Despite this general trend, we could only find a weak association between annual flow extremes and annual population change. This suggests intermediate variations in river flows may have a negligible influence on annual population change or are idiosyncratic in their effect within each waterway or on different life stages. The one population which did not follow this trend occurred in the largest waterway and was subject to legal recreational fishing, suggesting the magnitude of impacts of disturbance on populations occupying larger systems are reduced, and/or that recreational fishing hinders recovery rates following episodic disturbance events such as drought.

Although it is typically assumed that species use the habitat that is advantageous for survival and reproduction, anthropogenic changes to the environment can create ecological traps, making it critical to assess both habitat selection (e.g. where species congregate on the landscape) and the influence of selected habitats on the demographic processes that govern population dynamics.We used a long-term (1958-2011), large-scale, multi-species dataset for waterfowl that spans the United States and Canada to estimate species-specific responses to climate and land use variables in a landscape that has undergone significant environmental change across space and time. We first estimated the effects of change in climate and land use variables on habitat selection and population dynamics for nine species. We then hypothesized that species-specific responses to environmental change would scale with life-history traits, specifically: longevity, nesting phenology and female breeding site fidelity.We observed species-level heterogeneity in the demographic and habitat selection responses to climate and land use change, which would complicate community-level habitat management. Our work highlights the importance of multi-species monitoring and community-level analysis, even among closely related species.We detected several relationships between life-history traits, particularly nesting phenology, and species' responses to environmental change. One species, the early-nesting northern pintail (Anas acuta), was consistently at the extreme end of responses to land use and climate predictors and has been a species of conservation concern since their population began to decline in the 1980s. They, and the blue-winged teal, also demonstrated a positive habitat selection response to the proportion of cropland on the landscape that simultaneously reduced abundance the following year, indicative of susceptibility to ecological traps.By distilling the diversity of species' responses to environmental change within a community, our methodological approach and findings will help improve predictions of community responses to global change and can inform multi-species management and conservation plans in dynamic landscapes that are based on simple tenets of life-history theory.",,,,,"Buderman, Frances/AAT-2114-2020","Buderman, Frances/0000-0001-9778-9906",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JUN,2023,92,6,,,,,1267,1284,,10.1111/1365-2656.13919,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13919,,APR 2023,,,,,,36995500,,,,,WOS:000976760900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To examine how seasonal changes and the spatial heterogeneity of environments can interact to influence patterns and processes of population dynamics, we analyzed the data with two models of population variability: a population dynamics model, which provides knowledge about processes that determine population growth rates; and Taylor's power law, which summarizes the relationship between the temporal mean and variance of the size of a population (temporal mean-variance relationship). We found that seasonal differences were prevalent in population growth rates, as well as in the strength and spatial scales of processes that determine population growth rates. In addition, the seasonality of these rates and processes varied between habitats at different spatial scales ranging from the scale of among-rocks within a shore to that of among-regions located in different latitudes, suggesting that the effects of seasonal environmental fluctuations on population growth can depend on the spatial heterogeneity of biotic and abiotic conditions that vary at multiple spatial scales. In contrast, the evidence for spatiotemporal differences in temporal mean-variance relationships was weak. Unlike theoretical expectations, spatiotemporal differences in the variability of population size were best explained by a unique power law, despite remarkable regional and seasonal differences in the processes that determine population growth rates.

Life-history differences between herbivorous insects with eruptive and latent population dynamics are potentially useful for predicting population size variability. An association has also been demonstrated between herbivorous insect defence traits and the responses of various natural enemies. 2. Here predictions of population dynamics and natural enemy responses based on life-history and defence traits are tested using Gonometa postica Walker and G. rufobrunnea Aurivillius, two Southern Hemisphere Macrolepidoptera (Lasiocampidae) species. The temporal and spatial variation in pupal abundance and patterns of pupal parasitism and predation for both species are described and quantified for the first time. 3. Eleven sites were sampled over four generations across the region where both species have historically reached high population densities. Although there was evidence suggesting that population synchrony is driven by weather patterns, site-specific environmental differences contributed to the observed population variability. This study is the first to quantify the extent of population size variability of a species with an intermediate position on the eruptive-latent population dynamic gradient, where data on insect population dynamics is scarce. 4. Support for the life-history-population dynamic relationship was found, as intermediate population size variability for these species was observed. Larval and pupal defence traits, however, were poor and inconsistent predictors of mortality rate. Pupal cocoon structure differences, previously documented for these Gonometa species, may in fact explain the interspecific differences in natural enemy responses found. 5. Predicted population dynamics and natural enemy responses may, however, be overridden by ecological conditions.

Studies of transient population dynamics have largely focused on temporal changes in dynamical behaviour, such as the transition between periods of stability and instability. This study explores a related dynamic pattern, namely transient synchrony during a 49-year period among populations of five sympatric species of forest insects that share host tree resources. The long time series allows a more comprehensive exploration of transient synchrony patterns than most previous studies. Considerable variation existed in the dynamics of individual species, ranging from periodic to aperiodic. 2. We used time-averaged methods to investigate long-term patterns of synchrony and time-localized methods to detect transient synchrony. We investigated transient patterns of synchrony between species and related these to the species' varying density dependence structures; even species with very different density dependence exhibited at least temporary periods of synchrony. Observed periods of interspecific synchrony may arise from interactions with host trees (e.g., induced host defences), interactions with shared natural enemies or shared impacts of environmental stochasticity. 3. The transient nature of synchrony observed here raises questions both about the identity of synchronizing mechanisms and how these mechanisms interact with the endogenous dynamics of each species. We conclude that these patterns are the result of interspecific interactions that act only temporarily to synchronize populations, after which differences in the endogenous population dynamics among the species acts to desynchronize their dynamics.",,,,,"Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008; klapwijk, maartje johanna/D-8187-2013","Walter, Jonathan/0000-0003-2983-751X; klapwijk, maartje johanna/0000-0001-7690-045X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JUL,2018,87,4,,,SI,,1058,1068,,10.1111/1365-2656.12823,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12823,,,,,,,,29536534,,,,,WOS:000435940700014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The reactive changes in annual productivity and the reproductive threshold are accounted for by an additional term in the energy reserve dynamics. 3 If individuals show chaotic seed production, strongly correlated environmental fluctuations (the Moran effect) failed to produce a high positive correlation in seed production across the forest in the absence of pollen limitation. Regardless of the high nonlinearity of resource dynamics, a large correlation was maintained when both pollen limitation and correlated environmental fluctuation occurred. 4 We derived a regression formula for the degree of synchronization when pollen coupling occurred only on a local scale.

We evaluated how wetland dynamics in the North-American prairies (pond counts; a key parameter for several waterfowl populations) were related to spatial and temporal variation in the environment, as measured by weather variables, primary productivity and phenology derived from annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) curves, and agricultural composition of the landscape. Spatial and temporal variation in pond counts were closely related to these environmental variables. However, correlation strength and predictive ability of these environmental variables on wetland dynamics varied considerably across the study area. This variation was related to landscape characteristics and to the spatial scaling of the wetland dynamics, such that areas with late onset of spring, low spring temperature, high primary productivity, and high proportion of cropland had more predictable and spatially-homogenous dynamics.

As shared conditions can induce population synchrony, multi-population studies of key demographic parameters are imperative to explore the influence of climate change. We used long-term mark-recapture data and position data to determine non-breeding stop-over areas of 5 Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) populations over a latitudinal gradient in the Northeast Atlantic (56 degrees 11'-70 degrees 23' N). We investigated synchrony in adult survival in relation to shared stopover areas. We quantified effects of extreme extra-tropical cyclones (ETCs) specific to populations' stop-over areas and the North Atlantic Oscillation on adult survival. Populations with overlapping stop-over areas exhibited temporal synchrony in survival rates. Winter ETCs negatively influenced survival in 1 population, which was the one most exposed to extreme weather, but did not directly influence adult survival in the other 4 populations. Synchrony among populations with shared stop-over areas highlights the importance of these areas for adult survival, a key lifehistory rate.

In addition to trophic interactions such as predator-prey dynamics, there is some evidence that exogenous factor such as climatic variation may facilitate synchrony between different taxonomic groups. Using three longitudinal datasets on quail (Colinus virginianus) and cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) we examined 1) the consistency of synchrony across time and space, 2) the relative influence of trophic interactions vs. exogenous factors on synchrony and 3) if trophic interactions were positively associated with synchrony between populations. We found evidence of consistent synchrony in cotton rat and bobwhite populations at both the site and regional levels. We found that trophic interactions between cotton rats and bobwhite were associated with relative synchrony between these populations, but these interactions appeared to weaken in years of greater synchrony. We did not find evidence that exogenous factors influenced relative synchrony at the regional level. Given the lack of a clear mechanistic explanation of the patterns observed in our data, we propose an alternative climate-mediated predation framework to explain synchrony in complex predator-prey systems. This framework includes both classic bottom-up theories of regulation while integrating trophic interactions via components of the shared predator hypothesis.",,,,,,"Hooker, Katie/0000-0002-3655-5169; McCleery, Robert/0000-0001-7018-005X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,JUL 18,2023,11,,,,,,,,1159464,10.3389/fevo.2023.1159464,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1159464,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001040589200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While information exists on how the periods of oscillations vary among different species, there is little prior evidence of variation in periodicity within the range of a single Lepidopteran species. The exotic gypsy moth is an introduced foliage-feeding insect in North America. Its populations are characterized by high amplitude oscillations between innocuously low densities and outbreak levels during which large regions of forests are defoliated. These outbreaks are recognized to arise periodically with considerable synchrony across much of the gypsy moth's North American range. Our analysis indicates that gypsy moth outbreaks in North America are periodic but they exhibit two dominant periodicities: a primary period of 8-10 yr (as previously reported) and a secondary period of 4-5 yr (a new finding in this study). The outbreak periodicity varied geographically and this variation was associated with forest type. We found that in the most susceptible forest types, those on xeric sites where oak is often mixed with pines, outbreak periodicity had a more dominant 5-yr period while in forest types characteristic of more mesic sites where oak was mixed with maples and other species, cycles were clearly operating on a 10-yr period.",,,,,"Bjornstad, Ottar/I-4518-2012; Johnson, Derek/B-6409-2012; Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,,,,,JUN,2006,29,3,,,,,367,374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000238144400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Itame inhabits a subdivided habitat created by patches of its host plant Dr) as drummondii (Rosaceae) growing on bare ground. Habitat subdivision occurs both on the patch scale and on the larger spatial scale of sites due to patchy successional patterns. I surveyed five distinct sites to examine the relationships between plant patch size, patch isolation. Itame density, and pupal mass. I censused Itame caterpillar density in over 200 plant patches fur 1-3 years and found that densities were highest in medium-sized Dryas patches and lowest in very large carpets of Dryas. Isolated and small patches had high variance in density leading to lower mean densities. In contrast to density, pupal masses were highest in the largest patches, indicating a positive effect of patch size on individual fecundity, which was highly correlated with pupal mass. Results from the survey, as well as experimental manipulations of density, showed that Itame density had a negative effect on pupal mass. By using observed caterpillar densities and pupal masses to predict egg densities, I determined that the variance in pupal masses between patches was nut sufficient to explain the observed density-dependent population dynamics. Thus it appears that caterpillar density itself has mure important population-level impacts than does pupal mass. Contrary to predictions in the literature, this leads to the conclusion that smaller plant patches and the subdivided habitat that they constitute are disproportionally important for Itame populations. Temporal population dynamics were fairly synchronous between Dryas patches within sites but asynchronous between sites separated by >0.5 km, suggesting that sites may form distinct populations of Itame. This work shows the direct impacts of even very small-scale habitat patchiness on species distribution and abundance and how effects at the small spatial scale may combine with effects of larger scale subdivision to determine population structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,JUL,2000,81,7,,,,,1842,1857,,10.2307/177275,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/177275,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088214400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Embryo survival, incubation period, and length-at-hatch were inversely related to incubation temperature whereas yolk-sac volume increased with incubation temperature within study groups. However, varying magnitudes of responses among study groups suggested differential levels of developmental plasticity to climate change.

The probability of extinction for a single population in a continuous habitat was compared to that of multiple isolated, or semi-isolated, populations occupying a fragmented landscape with an equivalent total carrying capacity. Populations occupying a fragmented landscape were modelled for a range of dispersal rates and levels of asynchrony in the effects of environmental disturbances. Dispersal among subpopulations in the fragmented landscape partially alleviates the effect of fragmentation on extinction rates, despite the models explicitly incorporating disease epidemics which spread between subpopulations through dispersal. Even moderate environmental correlations among subpopulations greatly reduces the viability of the metapopulation relative to the case where the populations are totally independent. Whether a population performed better as a single population or as a metapopulation was strongly affected by the carrying capacity assumed, the time frame examined and the initial fitness of the population. A single population always fared better when the total habitat available was capable of supporting less than or equal to1000 adults. Thus, continued habitat fragmentation can be expected to fuel the ongoing global extinction crisis and conservation efforts should be aimed at interconnecting isolated habitat patches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1367-9430,1469-1795,,,,MAY,2004,7,,2,,,,181,191,,10.1017/S1367943004001313,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1367943004001313,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000221970100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Part 1: Model description,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Long-term studies of insect populations in the North American boreal forest have shown the vital importance of long-distance dispersal to the maintenance and expansion of insect outbreaks. In this work, we extend several concepts established previously in an empirically-based dispersal flight model with recent work on the physiology and behavior of the adult eastern spruce budworm (SBW) moth, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens). An outbreak of defoliating SBW in Quebec, ongoing since the mid-2000s, already covers millions of hectares of forests in eastern Canada and threatens to spread into neighboring areas through annual summertime episodes of long-distance dispersal. Such flight events in favorable conditions frequently include billions of SBW moths dispersing in the warm atmospheric boundary layer, typically starting around sunset and often lasting through several hours of wind-driven transport over hundreds of kilometers. Successful SBW dispersal to possibly distant host forest areas depends acutely on the weather. Here we describe the components and results of SBW-pyATM, an open-source individual-based modeling framework developed in Python for the simulation of these weatherdriven SBW dispersal events. Using seasonal SBW phenology results from BioSIM at known outbreak locations and high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model output, we focus on modeling dispersal flights over two successive nights in July 2013 in southern Quebec. Our flight model closely reproduces the SBW spatial patterns and motions observed by weather surveillance radar over the St. Lawrence estuary. With SBW-pyATM we can estimate landing locations for both male and female SBW and the resulting spatial patterns of egg distribution, allowing us eventually to forecast future larval defoliation activity in new locations where immigration could help overcome local limitations on SBW populations. This information could then support forest management decisions where SBW outbreaks threaten valuable resources.",,,,,"Sturtevant, Brian/KHV-0383-2024; Townsend, Philip/B-5741-2008; Garcia, Matthew/K-9286-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-1923,1873-2240,,,,MAR 15,2022,315,,,,,,,,108815,10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.108815,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.108815,,JAN 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000795677500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The role of climate dipoles in shaping ecological and evolutionary processes has been largely overlooked.

Despite their enormous economic and ecological impacts, we still have only limited understanding of the dynamics by which populations transition from normally stable endemic to irruptive densities. We investigated density-dependent changes in mountain pine beetle reliance on stressed hosts, host selection, spatial configuration of attacks, and the interaction of host selection and spatial configuration by performing a complete census of lodgepole pine across six stands and 6 years. In addition, we compared the dynamics of mountain pine beetle with those of other bark beetles. We found that as population size increased, reliance on stressed trees decreased and new attacks shifted to larger trees with thicker phloem and higher growth rates that can support higher offspring production. Moreover, the spatial configuration of beetle-attacked trees shifted from random to spatially aggregated. Further, we found evidence that beetle utilization of larger trees was related to aggregation behavior as the size of tree attacked was positively correlated at 10-25 m, within the effective distance of pheromone-mediated signaling. In contrast, non-irruptive bark beetle species did not exhibit such density-dependent spatial aggregation at the stand scale or switches in host selection behavior. These results identify how density-dependent linkages between spatial configuration and host utilization can converge to drive population transitions from endemic to irruptive phases. Specifically, a combination of stand-level spatial aggregation, behavioral shifts, and higher quality of attainable hosts defines a critical threshold beyond which continual population growth becomes self-driving.",,,,,", Claudio/KRP-6122-2024","Carroll, Allan/0000-0003-1820-0759; Gratton, Claudio/0000-0001-6262-9670; Howe, Michael/0000-0002-9694-0835",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,MAR,2022,198,3,,,,,681,698,,10.1007/s00442-022-05129-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-022-05129-4,,FEB 2022,,,,,,35226183,,,,,WOS:000762172200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Spatially coupled fluctuations are often seen in small rodent populations, albeit with local and regional variations. While both resource limitation and predation influence rodent dynamics, their relative importance for generating spatial variation is less clear, particularly during winter. In this study, we quantify spatial variation in winter abundance of the Norwegian lemming (Lemmus lemmus) across three ecologically connected mountain areas in northern Sweden and evaluate whether the relative strength of bottom-up and top-down regulation influences such variation. Our data included observations of predated and nonpredated winter nests as well as environmental characteristics of nest locations and nest predation. While the direction of annual changes in lemming nest abundance was perfectly synchronized among the three areas, there were differences in nest abundance, potentially caused by contrasting amplitudes of temporal fluctuations in lemming winter populations. Mustelid predation was positively associated with decreasing lemming populations but did not differ in occurrence among the three areas. Lemming nests were predominantly observed in meadows, whereas areas prone to flooding and close to the tree line were underrepresented. Mustelid predation was most common close to the tree line, but not associated with geomorphological characteristics related to snow depth. We suggest that the observed differences in lemming winter abundances were caused by variations in the relative strength of bottom-up and top-down regulation in the three mountain areas.

In this perspective, we explore the breadth of knowledge on how climate modes control reproduction in major masting species throughout Earth's biomes. We posit that intrinsic properties of climate modes (periodicity, persistence and trends) drive interannual and decadal variability of plant reproduction, as well as the spatial extent of its synchrony, aligning multiple proximate causes of masting through space and time. Moreover, climate modes force lagged but in-phase ecological processes that interact synergistically with multiple stages of plant reproductive cycles. This sets up adaptive benefits by increasing offspring fitness through either economies of scale or environmental prediction. Community-wide links between climate modes and masting across plant taxa suggest an evolutionary role of climate variability. We argue that climate modes may 'bridge' proximate and ultimate causes of masting selecting for variable and synchronous reproduction. The future of such interaction is uncertain: processes that improve reproductive fitness may remain coupled with climate modes even under changing climates, but chances are that abrupt global warming will affect Earth's climate modes so rapidly as to alter ecological and evolutionary links.

Temporal variation in radial growth synchrony among provenances may be modified by adverse climatic/biotic conditions such as drought or insect defoliation. However, these factors can potentially diminish provenance-specific growth reactions and, consequently, prevent the identification of provenances with the highest adaptive potential. Thus, understanding the influence of major biotic conditions on provenance-specific climate-growth relationships seems to be important to anticipate climate change. To determine provenance-specific growth patterns in relation to climate conditions (drought), seed production (reproductive effort), and insect defoliation in a common garden of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), we applied dendroecological techniques to time-series of tree-ring widths and basal area increments. The long-term records of seed production and insect outbreaks from the local Scots pine stands were used to explain the potential effect of biotic factors on the temporal dynamics of radial growth synchrony. During a period of favorable growth conditions, Scots pine provenances showed a decline in inter-provenance synchronicity in growth patterns, while during years affected by severe soil water deficit and insect defoliation, they manifested high uniformity in growth dynamics.

Settlement data were collected from 1994 to 2011 along the Southern Australian and New Zealand coasts. We identified common settlement trends at a regional scale (100500 km): the magnitude of settlement at sites from South Australia (SA) and Victoria (VIC) were similar, but different to sites in Tasmania (TAS). In New Zealand, three spatial regions were identified: northern (NNZ), middle (MNZ) and southern regions (SNZ). Higher settlement in SA, VIC and MNZ occurred in years with higher rainfall and storms in spring and El Nino conditions. In TAS and SNZ, higher settlement occurred during La Nina conditions. These results suggest that settlement over regional scales is modulated by oceanic processes, but outcomes vary between regions. At a local scale, a higher wave period and wind relaxation were relatively more important than the sea surface temperature (SST) in SA and VIC. In TAS, the current velocity also influenced the strength of settlement. However, much of the local settlement variability was not explained by the models suggesting that settlement in J. edwardsii is a complex process where larval behaviour, biological factors and oceanographic processes interact over different scales.

We used climate data to analyze the history of minimum air temperatures and reconstruct physiological effects of cold on D. ponderosae. We evaluated relations between winter temperatures and beetle abundance using aerial detection survey data. Extreme winter temperatures have warmed by about 4 A degrees C since 1960 across the western US. At the broadest scale, D. ponderosae population dynamics between 1997 and 2010 were unrelated to variation in minimum temperatures, but relations between cold and D. ponderosae dynamics varied among regions. In the 11 coldest ecoregions, lethal winter temperatures have become less frequent since the 1980s and beetle-caused tree mortality increased-consistent with the climatic release hypothesis. However, in the 12 warmer regions, recent epidemics cannot be attributed to warming winters because earlier winters were not cold enough to kill D. ponderosae. There has been pronounced warming of winter temperatures throughout the western US, and this has reduced previous constraints on D. ponderosae abundance in some regions.

Here, following the selection of one uncertain parameter value using empirical measurements, we used those radar observations for the quantitative calibration of two uncertain flight model variables in our individual-based SBW-pyATM model, one that describes the conversion of moth wingbeat to flight speed, and a second that allows the moth to conserve energy during flight. For these experiments, we adapted a grid-based metric from meteorology that has previously been used to calibrate and validate precipitation forecasts by comparison with radar data. Through thousands of flight simulations for the night of 15-16 July 2013, examining each of these parameters separately and in conjunction, we arrived at optimal values that produce a spatiotemporal distribution of SBW moth dispersal that most closely matches the radar observations for that night. We then applied those calibrated parameter values to simulations of SBW dispersal on the night of 14-15 July 2013 and found a lesser but still reasonable resemblance to weather radar observations on that night as well. These two parameters have significant effects on the speed, altitude, and distance of dispersal, and are thus critical to the goal of estimating when and where SBW males and females land, with subsequent effects on reproductive behavior and the spatial redistribution of SBW populations over a dispersal season.",,,,,"Sturtevant, Brian/KHV-0383-2024; Garcia, Matthew/K-9286-2013","Garcia, Matthew/0000-0002-9637-4204",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-1923,1873-2240,,,,OCT 15,2024,357,,,,,,,,110210,10.1016/j.agrformet.2024.110210,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2024.110210,,SEP 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001307775300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding the process of synchronization of dynamics is therefore a crucial aspect of understanding outbreak dynamics. We studied the second-order log-linear (autoregressive) model to ask what patterns of synchronization across invasion fronts may be expected from Moran's model. Generally, we show that the time to synchronization in the log-linear model is a complex function of a number of parameters of which the overall strength of regulation, the strength of delayed statistical density dependence, and the relaxation time seem to be of particular importance. Interestingly, while environmental correlation is the crucial determinant of the magnitude of asymptotic synchrony, it does not appear to influence the transient process of synchronization. However, synchronization proceeds much more quickly among weakly periodic populations than among populations that are strongly periodic. As a case study, we investigate synchronization following colonization by gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations located along the species's expanding invasion front in northeastern USA. Data consisted of more than 100 years of county quarantine records and 30 years of detailed defoliation maps. We found that the dynamics of new populations tended to be initially out of synch with the broadly synchronized outbreaks within the established range. However, the outbreak dynamics of these new populations lock on to the regional patterns very quickly-within 10-15 years of invasion. Focusing on parameters that produce periodicity comparable to that seen in real gypsy moth populations, we discuss how the observed synchronization compares to that predicted by the log-linear model. While our results are equivocal, the synchronization appears to be surprisingly rapid, so more mechanistic models may be needed to explain the synchronization observed in this case study.",,,,,"Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008; Bjornstad, Ottar/I-4518-2012; Johnson, Derek/B-6409-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-3896,1438-390X,,,,OCT,2008,50,4,,,,,379,389,,10.1007/s10144-008-0105-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-008-0105-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000260069600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effects of weather on local forest stand defoliation and mortality transitions, along with defoliation spread probability and distance, were estimated statistically.

Genetically related groups may consist of the same demographic unit or a single population,'' because high levels of dispersal may synchronize population dynamics. We examined this hypothesis by assessing the levels of synchrony in seven demographic parameters among locations supporting stream-dwelling Dolly Varden. We analyzed synchrony using demographic data collected over 10 years in five neighboring tributary streams (<7 km) where little genetic divergence was observed. The overall synchrony was moderate for age-0+ and >= age-1+ (average cross-correlation coefficient <(rho)over bar> = 0.32-0.56), but the synchrony decreased at later life stages (mature adults, (rho) over bar = 0.00-0.43). No significant temporal co-variation was observed for other demographic parameters (sex ratio and resident-to-migrant ratio, (rho) over bar = -0.19 and 0.38, respectively). Therefore, it appears that demographic synchrony was more prevalent for early life stages, but less so for later life stages, suggesting the demography of each tributary is unique. Furthermore, since an isolated location showed high levels of synchrony with the other locations, the main driver of synchrony is likely correlated environmental influences on demography (Moran effect) rather than dispersal. Pairwise synchrony was not correlated with geographical distance, but negatively correlated with the degree of genetic differentiation (F(ST)) in a few cases. Overall, however, we found little evidence that dispersal induces strong synchrony even among the neighboring tributaries where genetic analysis indicated considerable dispersal. Finally it is worth noting that the influences of dispersal may be different in terms of genetic and demographic contexts, and that density-dependent processes may mask patterns of observed synchrony.",,,,,"Koizumi, Itsuro/D-4222-2009","Yamamoto, Shoichiro/0000-0003-4155-7852",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-3896,,,,,OCT,2008,50,4,,,,,367,377,,10.1007/s10144-008-0108-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-008-0108-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000260069600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examined potential effects of natural enemies on this phase lag using field experiments and observational data. We found that larval parasitism was significantly higher in autumnal than in winter moths. Conversely, pupal predation by generalist invertebrates was clearly greater in winter than in autumnal moths. The difference in parasitism rates may contribute to the earlier collapse of the autumnal moth cycle.

Landscape patterning in consumer population dynamics may be largely the result of interactions between consumers and their predators, or driven by spatial variation in basal resources. Empirical testing of these alternatives has been limited by the lack of suitable data. In this study, we analyzed an extensive network of spatially replicated time series to characterize the local and regional processes affecting spatio-temporal dynamics of a tree-killing bark beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis or SPB) and its key predator (Thanasimus dubius) across the southeastern United States. We first used a mechanistic model to evaluate factors affecting the stability of 95 predator-prey time series and then conducted spatial analyses to evaluate scale dependence in the factors affecting the geographical patterning of this system. Across the region, population fluctuations of both species were correlated in space beyond 400 km but there was notable spatial variation in the deterministic and stochastic processes influencing forest-scale (local) fluctuations. Time series analyses indicated that local dynamics of SPB and T. dubius are not cyclical. Instead, the abundance of T. dubius responded almost instantaneously to changes in SPB abundance. Spatial variation in long-term forest-scale abundance of both species was linked most strongly to the abundance of pine habitat indicating a stronger role for resource availability in SPB population dynamics than top-down effects. Our results are consistent with other studies indicating that animal populations tend to be synchronized in space via spatially correlated processes such as weather; yet local dynamics tend to be linked to smaller-scale host patterns. Our study provides a rare empirical assessment of how local processes scale up to produce landscape patterns that influence forest ecology and forest management.",,,,,"Weed, Aaron/N-6918-2013; Liebhold, Andrew/C-1423-2008; Ayres, Matthew/AAI-6873-2020","Ayres, Matthew/0000-0001-6120-9068; Weed, Aaron/0000-0002-4619-3042",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,JAN,2017,40,1,,,,,221,234,,10.1111/ecog.02046,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02046,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000394670600020,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we investigate the spatial genetic structure and spatial variation in genetic diversity of two important species of spruce budworm larval parasitoids during outbreaks: Apanteles fumiferanae Viereck (Braconidae) and Glypta fumiferanae (Viereck) (Ichneumonidae).

Using DAPC, PCA, AMOVA, and IBD analyses, we found evidence for panmixia and high genetic connectivity for both species, matching the previously described genetic structure of the spruce budworm within the same context, suggesting similar effective dispersal during outbreaks and high parasitoid population densities between outbreaks. We also found a significant negative relationship between genetic diversity and latitude for A. fumiferanae but not for G. fumiferanae, suggesting that northern range limits may vary by species within the spruce budworm parasitoid community.

Analysis of spatial divergence, and morphological traits in relation to other factors, are of high interest both for management and in ecological studies. Morphology can help to delineate stocks, inform about local adaptations as well as ecological role the species play in the ecosystem. Morphological variation and differentiation of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has been thoroughly studied in small freshwater systems, but less is known about differentiation of the species in an open marine system. The Baltic Sea inherits substantial environmental gradients in salinity, temperature, as well as in the nature and intensity of predation, gradients that all can foster local morphological adaptation and potential population differentiation. Previous studies have revealed some morphological differentiation of the species along the coast, but studies from the offshore are lacking. In this study we used traditional as well as geometric morphometrics to analyse divergence in morphological traits like body plate numbers, body- and otolith shape among sticklebacks from two major genetic clusters inhabiting different parts of the Baltic Sea. Our results show that fish from one area (Curonian Lagoon) representing one of the clusters had significantly higher number of body plates, potentially indicating a response to higher predation pressure compared to the other areas studied. Body shape also significantly differed among locations with deeper bodied fish in the Curonian Lagoon. The most conservative and least plastic trait studied, otolith shape, did, however, not show any divergence among the areas studied. Our results suggest morphological divergence in plastic traits like body plates and body shape in response to local environmental conditions. The lack of divergence in otolith shape further suggests that the degree of population differentiation is weak or rather recent, as also highlighted in earlier studies using molecular markers or synchrony in population abundances.

Accurate estimation of pest population density in ecosystems, especially in agro-ecosystems, is therefore very important, and this is the overall goal of the pest insect monitoring. However, this is a complex and challenging task; providing accurate information about pest abundance is hardly possible without taking into account the complexity of ecosystems' dynamics, in particular, the existence of multiple scales. In the case of pest insects, monitoring has three different spatial scales, each of them having their own scale-specific goal and their own approaches to data collection and interpretation.

Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to estimate age-0 recruitment trends. Spatial and temporal synchrony analyses were then conducted using annual GAM-predicted values to determine if trends were similar between estuaries in close proximity, and if declines occurred at the same time. Because the species is dependent on physical transport (i.e., winds and tides) for recruitment, hourly wind speed, wind direction, water temperature, and air temperature were obtained for estuaries with non-zero sampling totals and long-term data sets. Only six estuaries showed significant relationships between age-0 flounder indices and growing degree days. However, all estuaries with wind data showed significant relationships between age-0 flounder indices and hourly summed wind speed. Southern flounder also have environmental sex determination, meaning warming estuaries could also account for population changes and declines. We document that water temperatures in the same space and time where southern flounder sexually determine are warmer now than even a decade ago, which could masculinize populations and substantially change population demographics. These results illustrate the vulnerability of estuarine finfish populations to climate change and increased climate variability. Understanding how climate acts on southern flounder biology may help managers respond to and prevent fishery collapses.",,,,,"Ballenger, Joseph/O-7078-2018","Midway, Stephen/0000-0003-0162-1995",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JUN,2021,27,11,,,,,2520,2536,,10.1111/gcb.15568,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15568,,MAR 2021,,,,,,33738904,,,,,WOS:000630285100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, in temperate forests, bottom-up forces often exert a strong influence on ecosystem functioning. Here, we report on the indirect influence of a pulsed resource, sugar maple (Acer saccharum) seed production, on nest survival in a migratory songbird. We hypothesized that seed production in year t would determine daily nest survival rate in year t+1 through its effects on seed-eating rodents. We used the density of sugar maple seedlings (with cotyledons) in year t+1 as a proxy for seed production in year t and predicted that it would be inversely related to songbird nest survival the same year. We estimated the density of sugar maple seedlings, eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) activity, and daily nest survival rate in the ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) over four successive years in a northern hardwood forest of New Brunswick, Canada. Seedling density varied by two orders of magnitude between years, whereas an index of chipmunk activity changed by an order of magnitude. Both variables were positively correlated and negatively correlated to daily nest survival rate. A logistic-exposure model including only seedling density received the greatest level of support (lowest AIC(c)). Previous studies have reported the effect of sugar maple masting on seed-eating rodent populations, but the strong link we report between seedling density and songbird nest survival is novel. A nocturnal seed-eating nest predator, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), was not considered in our models, which may explain why chipmunk was not the best predictor of daily nest survival rate. The trophic linkages we observed are remarkably strong for a temperate forest ecosystem and might become more prevalent in northeastern North America, at least on calcium-rich soils, with the loss of large-diameter beech trees as a result of beech bark disease.",,,,,"Vernouillet, Alizée/ABC-5045-2021; Villard, Marc-André/ISR-7944-2023","Vernouillet, Alizee/0000-0003-2525-2936",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,DEC,2017,7,24,,,,,10733,10742,,10.1002/ece3.3581,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3581,,,,,,,,29299253,,,,,WOS:000418824800023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, the demonstration of periodicity in the population dynamics of forest defoliators is of great interest for developing predictive risk models. We took advantage of 32 years time series recorded on permanent plots throughout France to test for the cyclicity of T. pityocampa outbreaks, estimate the length of cyclic periods and investigate synchrony between regions. Spectral analysis revealed that a large majority of regions and clusters of monitoring plots show significantly periodic outbreaks with a return period of seven to nine years. Outbreaks were not synchronous across the whole country but in neighbouring regions. Several factors such as low host tree quality following defoliation, impact of natural enemies and prolonged diapause might drive the cyclicity of T. pityocampa outbreaks while the Moran effect, here the role of low temperatures, is likely to explain synchrony.

Altered climatic regimes have the potential to allow native forest insects to express novel behaviors and expand in latitude and elevation beyond their hypothesized thermal tolerances. Yet, disentangling the drivers of novel behaviors and range expansions is difficult due to cross-scalar interactions that dictate forest insect population dynamics. We investigated the irruptive dynamics of western balsam bark beetle (Dryocoetes confusus Swaine), which undergoes intermittent, long-lasting, but low-severity outbreaks in subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa Hook) forests. We compiled data from 1998 to 2019 across British Columbia, Canada, at 1 and 16 km(2) resolutions to describe the spatiotemporal structure of beetle outbreaks, predict the landscape susceptibility to outbreaks, explain when outbreaks occur based on bioclimatic drivers, explore whether beetle populations exhibit self driving growth, and determine whether the extent of outbreaks has increased. Overall, we found that outbreaks occur in discrete clusters and are synchronous at distances of 10-25 km. Further, we found that landscape susceptibility to beetle outbreaks was best explained by latitude*elevation (i.e., the product of latitude [m] and elevation [m] Z-standardized) and volume of fir (m(3)/ha; > 17.5 cm size class; > 100 yrs.) both within 8 km and each pixel. Meanwhile, a longer growing season, increased growing degree day accumulation, and drought best explained when outbreaks occurred. Further, we did not find evidence to suggest that beetle populations exhibit self-driving population growth. Finally, we found that the extent of beetle outbreaks has increased over the last 20 years and that increases in landscape susceptibility primarily occurred at higher latitude*elevations and were best explained by an increase in the mean growing season and degree day accumulation. In other words, abnormally warm temperatures have facilitated a northward and upward expansion of western balsam bark beetle. Collectively, these results serve as the first quantification of the spatiotemporal dynamics of this understudied insect and support previous modeling efforts to investigate the multi-scale drivers of western balsam bark beetle outbreaks. We propose that future work should identify specific supercooling points, the relationship between temperature and development rate, and how the relatively high within-stand variability in age and size class of subalpine fir affect the irruptive dynamics of this understudied bark beetle.",,,,,,"Howe, Michael/0000-0002-9694-0835",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1127,1872-7042,,,,MAR 15,2022,508,,,,,,,,120047,10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120047,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120047,,JAN 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000784301100012,View Full Record in Web of Science

We compared correlations in salmonid density in central Idaho and examined the relationships between changes in salmonid density and the variation in large-scale bioclimatic conditions as indexed by stream flow, air temperature, drought, coastal upwelling, and the number of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha redds (a surrogate for nutrient influx and therefore increased stream productivity). The average densities of six stream-dwelling salmonid fishes were highly synchronous, with declines from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s followed by a rebound through 2003. All pairwise correlations were positive and 8 of 15 were statistically significant. Stream flow and Chinook salmon redds were correlated with fish densities as a group, but the importance of bioclimatic indices differed by species and varied by the lag times applied. Stream flow 3 and 4 years previous was most important for brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and bull trout S. confluentus. The presence of Chinook salmon redds from the previous year was most important for Chinook salmon. The coastal upwelling index 4 years previous was most important for mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni and steelhead O. mykiss. No variable captured much of the variation in the density of westslope cutthroat trout O. clarkii lewisi. Models based on data from 1985 to 2003 correctly predicted the synchronous declines in fish density observed for all species from 2004 to 2009, suggesting that the bioclimatic indices we chose were useful surrogates for large-scale factors influencing the temporal changes in salmonid densities in central Idaho. For fishery managers, interspecies synchrony may allow a more powerful multispecies approach to monitoring and reveal the tractability of large systems to management control. However, causal mechanisms are hard to infer and require further research (e.g., the effects of ocean conditions).

We propose the method of 'phase analysis' for studying the spatio-temporal fluctuations of animal populations, and use this method for helping identify remarkable synchronized population fluctuations that may sometimes be found over very large spatial domains. 2. The method requires decomposing the observed time series of population fluctuations into two components-one that quantifies the changing phase of the signal, and the other that quantifies the changing amplitude. 3. Two populations are considered to be 'phase synchronized' if there is locking or synchrony between their phase components, while their associated amplitudes may nevertheless remain largely uncorrelated. 4. Since environmental noise often masks population synchrony, a null hypothesis approach is used to detect whether the phase variables are locked more than would be expected by chance alone. 5. The technique is thus particularly appropriate for ecological analyses where it is often important to study evidence of weak interactions in irregular non-stationary and noisy time series. Because climatic patterns (and predicted climate changes) almost certainly influence population dynamics, the approach appears particularly relevant for analysing the potential links between climatic fluctuations and population abundance.",,,,,"Cazelles, Bernard/B-1572-2013","Cazelles, Bernard/0000-0002-7972-361X; Stone, Lewi/0000-0002-6465-579X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,NOV,2003,72,6,,,,,953,968,,10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00763.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00763.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000186432900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This phenomenon can be caused by similar environmental conditions across physically separated populations. In the context of the ongoing climate change, it is essential to test this hypothesis, identify the factors driving the synchrony and elucidate the mechanisms, in the attempt to improve fisheries management. This study investigates synchronic variations in European whitefish (Coregonus spp.) populations in five peri-alpine lakes. The hypothesis suggests that shared biotic or abiotic factors contribute to similar trends in whitefish landings. Environmental and seasonal variables impacting the early life stages of the species were analyzed, and the Euclidean distances between the multivariate time series were calculated to identify similarities or dissimilarities in lake environmental parameters. We found that regional winter and spring temperatures were consistent across the lakes, but these factors did not fully account for variations in landings statistics. Wind intensity, water level and zooplankton abundance showed lake-specific patterns that could better explain local conditions and dynamics. Linear models did not reveal a coherent correlation with a common environmental variable across all lakes. However, distinct relationships were found in four of the lakes, with local factors significantly contributing to abundance variations. The spring abundance ofDaphnia spp., a primary food source for whitefish larvae, was the main factor correlated with fish landing trends in Lake Geneva and Lake Bourget. Higher availability ofDaphnia spp. may decrease intraspecific competition and density-dependent mortality. In Lake Neuchatel, winter water temperature was negatively mortality. temperature negatively correlated with fish abundance proxies, suggesting that warmer winters may compromise reproduction success. Lake Annecy saw an increase in whitefish landings following a substantial re- duction in fishing efforts during the late 2000s. A significant negative correlation was found between whitefish landings and fishing efforts. No relationship was found for Lake Aiguebelette, maybe due to a lack of zooplankton data. In conclusion, the ob- served synchrony in the European whitefish population is likely driven by a combination of interacting environmental and an- thropogenic factors rather than a single common variable.

Across regional landscapes, spatially separated sub-populations may fluctuate in synchrony, or exhibit sub-structuring due to subtle differences in local intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Using a long-term data set (17-22 yr) obtained from a large (8000 km(2)) study region in arid central Australia, we tested firstly for regional synchrony in annual rainfall and the dynamics of five small mammal species across nine widely separated sites. Using Moran's theorem, we predicted that the spatial correlation between the regional sub-populations of these species would equal that between local density-independent conditions (annual rainfall). For species that showed synchronous spatial dynamics, we then used multivariate state-space (MARSS) models to predict that regional rainfall would be positively associated with their populations, whereas species with asynchronous sub-populations would be influenced largely by other factors. For these latter species, we used MARSS models to test four hypotheses. These were that sub-population structures: (1) were asynchronous and governed by local site-specific factors, (2) differed between oasis and non-oasis sites, (3) differed between burnt and unburnt sites, and (4) differed between three sub-regions with different rainfall gradients. We found that the spatial population dynamics of our study small mammals differed between and within families. Two species of insectivorous dasyurid marsupials showed asynchronous dynamics, which most likely tracked local conditions, whereas a larger carnivorous marsupial and two species of rodents had strongly synchronous dynamics. These latter species exhibited similar spatial correlations to local and regional rainfall events, providing evidence that the Moran effect operates for some, but not all, species in this arid system. Our results suggest that small mammal populations do not respond in similar ways to shared environmental drivers in arid regions, and hence will vary in their responses to climate change. As arid lands globally are predicted to face climatic shifts that will exacerbate rainfall-drought cycles, we suggest that future work focuses on exploring these responses at different spatial scales across multiple dryland taxa.",,,,,"Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019; Greenville, Aaron/G-9718-2013; Wardle, Glenda/D-6533-2016; Dickman, Christopher/AEP-7042-2022","Greenville, Aaron/0000-0002-0113-4778; Wardle, Glenda/0000-0003-0189-1899; Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730; Nguyen, Vuong/0000-0001-9070-9803",,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,MAY,2016,7,5,,,,,,,e01343,10.1002/ecs2.1343,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1343,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000377215200037,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evidence suggests that dispersal is influenced by landscape structure, phenology, temperature, and air currents; however, the details remain unclear due to the difficulty of quantifying dispersal. In this study, we used data on the abundance and distribution of spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana larvae (potential dispersers) and adult male moths (dispersers) to make inference on the effects of air currents and host-species abundance on dispersal. Hierarchical-Bayesian and inverse modeling was used to explore 4 dispersal models: 1) isotropic dispersal; 2) directional-dispersal; 3) directional-and-host-species dispersal; and 4) host-species dispersal. Despite their strong dependence on balsam fir Abies balsamea and spruce species Picea spp., the mapped basal area of these host species did not influence the pattern of dispersed moths. The model that best fit the data was the directional-dispersal model, which showed that the prevailing dispersal direction was from the northwest (328 degrees). We infer that the strong pattern of directional dispersal was due to a prevailing wind from the same direction. Our interpretation was corroborated by independent wind data during the period of active adult male budworm flight, particularly in the region with high larval abundance. Our results indicate that there was a relatively high probability of individuals flying at least 48 km with the wind where larvae abundance at source locations was also high. Such findings emphasize the importance of long-distance dispersal on spatial distribution of adult male spruce budworms.

Evidence suggests that recent changes in outbreak distribution and duration can be attributed to climate warming. There is hence an immediate need for methods that can be applied to characterize the geographical distribution of outbreaks. Here we assess the reliability of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) 16-day NDVI data for generating time series of the distribution of defoliation caused by moths attacking birch forest in Fennoscandia. We do so by first establishing the relationship between ground measures of moth larval density and a defoliation score based on MODIS-NDVI. We then calibrate and validate a model with the MODIS-NDVI defoliation score as a classifier to discriminate between areas with and without visible defoliation as identified from orthophotos and provide two examples of application of the model. We found the MODIS defoliation score to be a valid proxy for larval density (R(2)=0.88-0.93) above a certain, low threshold (a defoliation score of -5%). Areas with and without visible defoliation could be discriminated based on defoliation score with a substantial strength of agreement (max kappa = 0.736), and the resulting model was able to predict the proportion of area with visible defoliation in independent test areas with good reliability across the range of proportions. We conclude that satellite-derived defoliation patterns can be an invaluable tool for generating indirect population dynamical data that permits the development of targeted monitoring on relevant regional scales.

However, such potential synchrony among species or populations may be tempered by dynamics operating at finer temporal and spatial scales, as well as species-specific responses to environmental conditions. We examined within- and among-species synchrony in year-class strength across 130 lakes in northern Indiana over 30 years to evaluate the relative scale of potential synchrony and its possible ecological mechanisms in five recreationally important fish species: black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), redear sunfish (L. microlophus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Bluegill and black crappie recruitment was significantly positively correlated when the species coexisted, and relative year-class strength of both species was positively related to mean annual wind speed. However, there were few other instances of recruitment synchrony between or within species, regardless of whether synchrony was assessed within or among lake systems. In addition, habitat similarity and regional weather patterns also played a limited and inconsistent role in shaping recruitment strength or synchrony in these small inland systems.
